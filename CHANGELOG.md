# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- This section becomes `## [0.1.0] - <date>` on the day the tag is cut, and the
     link definitions at the foot are filled in then. It was written as a released
     0.1.0 dated 2026-08-01 while no tag, no GitHub release and no PyPI
     distribution existed, so the compare/tag links below resolved to nothing. A
     changelog that claims a release is the one file a reader trusts about what was
     released. -->

### Added
- Initial public release of spectraMR.
- Multi-paradigm training framework: 206 `training_mode` keys resolving to 153
  training-strategy classes.
- 586 registered models, reachable from a cold import after
  `populate_model_registry()`.
- 217 registered losses and 213 registered metrics, across image, k-space,
  complex, physics, adversarial, latent, distillation and virtual-fiducial
  domains.

<!-- Every count above is a REGISTRATION count, produced by calling
     populate_model_registry() and reading len(MODEL_REGISTRY) -- not a
     decorator-site grep. The two
     are different questions and nothing in CI compares them: a grep counts every
     textual occurrence, including the ones in comments, docstrings and tests, while
     the registry is what a config can actually reach. They also drift, in both
     directions -- the metric count above was 211 here and measured 213, and the
     model count of 590 above is an earlier reading than the rest. Re-run the snippet
     before changing a number here; do not carry one forward, and do not let a
     verified number vouch for its neighbour. -->
- Three-tier audit ladder (Tier 0 schema, Tier 1 static cross-validation,
  Tier 2 synthetic forward probe).
- MRI physics single source of truth under `src/spectramr/infrastructure/physics/`.
- Sphinx documentation and a Read the Docs build configuration
  (`.readthedocs.yaml`). The hosted site is not live as of v0.1.0.
- Apache-2.0 licence + clinical-use disclaimer.
- PyPI Trusted Publishing pipeline (`release.yml`) producing wheel + sdist on tag
  push. Nothing has been published to PyPI as of v0.1.0.
- GitHub Actions CI on pull requests: a blocking `pr-required` lane (changed-line
  lint, repository guards, architecture fitness functions, unit-test collection,
  physics tests, dependency and secret scanning) aggregated behind a single
  `required` check; an advisory `pr-advisory` lane (full lint, mypy, pre-commit,
  docs build, dependency review, zizmor); and CodeQL. The blocking lane runs the
  physics and architecture suites and **collects** the unit suite — it does not
  execute the full unit suite, which is too long for per-PR CI.
- Issue templates (bug / feature / paradigm-proposal) and PR template with DCO
  sign-off checklist.

<!-- Restore these once v0.1.0 is tagged; both 404 until then.
