"""Knob applicability — which config blocks are meaningful for which regime.

Some config blocks only make sense for a specific imaging regime: an ``mrf:``
trajectory block is inert under ``mri_structural``; a ``data.quantitative``
target-map block is meaningless unless you are mapping parameters. This is the
inverse of scattering that knowledge across each block's validator — one SSOT
table, consumed by ``check_knob_applicability``.

Scope is **regime-gated** here. Modality gating ("coil arrays are meaningless
for ultrasound") is deliberately *not* modelled yet: every runnable regime in
this framework is MR, and the non-MR regimes are ``STUB`` — an arm declaring
one is already rejected by ``check_workflow_declared`` before any knob is
reached, so a modality gate could never fire. It will be added alongside the
first non-MR regime, so the table never carries a rule that cannot fire.
