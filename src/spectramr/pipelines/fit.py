"""In-process training entry point for the scripting mode — ``fit`` / ``Trainer``.

The imperative peer of the config-driven ``spectramr train``: a user brings their
own ``model`` / ``optimizer`` / dataloaders in Python and runs training directly,
**reusing the same loop** the config path uses. ``fit`` assembles a
:class:`TrainingEnvironment` from those objects (via
:meth:`TrainingEnvironment.from_components`) and drives
:func:`spectramr.pipelines.train.run_training_pipeline` with that environment, so
there is exactly one training loop — no duplicate engine.

Paradigms: ``fit(paradigm=...)`` selects the training paradigm (the strategy the
factory resolves) and the sensible default config/loss block for it:

* ``reconstruction`` (default) — supervised image L1.
* ``diffusion`` — adds the ``training.diffusion`` block (timesteps/schedule).
* ``vae`` / ``vqvae`` — adds the ``losses.latent`` (KL / commitment) block.
* ``gan`` — wires a second model (``discriminator``) + optimizer (``opt_d``) and
  the mandatory ``losses.gan`` block; you MUST pass ``discriminator=`` (or set
  ``model.discriminator_component`` in ``config``) or it raises (a GAN without a
  discriminator silently collapses to plain L1 — pitfall #9/#16).
* ``ssl`` / ``mae`` / ``physics_equivariant_ssl`` — self-supervised paradigms.

``paradigm`` is validated against the registered strategy short-names; an unknown
value raises. For full control, pass a ready ``strategy=`` (used verbatim) or a
complete ``config`` (its ``training.strategy_class`` is authoritative).

.. note::

   Your dataloaders must yield batches as a mapping with the canonical keys
   ``"input"`` and ``"target"`` (``BatchAdapter`` raises on non-canonical keys);
   for non-recon paradigms the ``model`` you pass must itself be
   paradigm-appropriate (e.g. a VAE model that emits ``(recon, mu, logvar)`` — a
   plain UNet would degrade to a zero-KL autoencoder; a diffusion model must
   accept a timestep).
