# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unwrap helper — re-exported from the SSOT in ``core/``.
#
# This used to be an ``isinstance``-based DP/DDP-only implementation living here,
# in ``pipelines/``. Two problems: it handled neither ``torch.compile``'s
# ``_orig_mod`` nor FSDP's ``_fsdp_wrapped_module``, and it sat on the wrong side
# of an import edge — ``infrastructure/`` (where every checkpoint writer lives)
# may not import from ``pipelines/``, so the writers could not reach it. It had
# ZERO callers in ``src/``.
#
# The implementation now lives in ``spectramr.core.module_utils``, the rightmost
# layer, reachable from ``pipelines/``, ``infrastructure/``, ``models/`` and
# ``cli/`` alike. The name is kept here because it is the historical import path.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ``apply_parallelism`` and its ``_wrap_data_parallel`` / ``_wrap_ddp`` /
# ``_apply_distributed_samplers`` helpers lived here and are gone.
#
# It implemented none/dp/ddp in an if/elif/else and RAISED on anything else,
# while FSDP was reached through a separate ``parallel.fsdp.enabled`` flag read
# in ModelBuilder. So ``strategy: 'fsdp'`` -- the spelling the reference template
# advertised -- raised ValueError AFTER the whole training environment had been
# built, and ``strategy: 'none'`` + ``fsdp.enabled: true`` silently sharded.
#
# It also wrapped everything at one point in the build, which cannot be right for
# both: FSDP must wrap BEFORE optimizers exist (it re-points parameter storage),
# DP/DDP after (so downstream consumers still see a bare module).
#
# Replaced by the plugin registry in
# ``spectramr.infrastructure.distributed.strategy_registry``, dispatched from
# ``TrainingEnvironmentDirector`` at two ordered hooks.

#: group, so "rank 0" is a real question. ``none``/``dp`` are single-process

    opened a writer on the same event directory and interleaved their scalars.

    Same four guards as ``is_rank_zero`` and deliberately so: the question "which
    rank am I" is only meaningful under exactly the conditions that make "am I
    rank 0" meaningful, and answering it twice with two guard sets is how the two
    drift apart. This returns the rank itself rather than a boolean collapse of it.

    No ``os.environ["RANK"]`` fallback on purpose. ``setup_distributed()`` runs
    before ``run_training_pipeline`` (``pipelines/distributed.py``), so the process
    group is always initialised on the only path where the rank matters, and
    ``strategy: 'none'`` with ``RANK`` set already raises there. A fallback could
    therefore only fire in states the pipeline has already refused, while adding a
    second source of truth for the rank.
