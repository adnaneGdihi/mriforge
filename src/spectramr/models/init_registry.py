"""Model Discovery Initialization
==============================

This module is responsible for eagerly importing model modules to ensure
they are registered in the global MODEL_REGISTRY via the @register_model decorator.

# a "registry is non-empty" check: ``@register_model`` decorators fire
# eagerly as model packages are imported (populating a partial subset),
