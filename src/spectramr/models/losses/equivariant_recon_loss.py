r"""Equivariant SSL reconstruction — measurement-domain symmetry.

For a known group action :math:`R` (rotation, flip, translation, …)
that commutes with the forward operator :math:`\mathbf{A}`, the true
reconstruction satisfies :math:`f(R\mathbf{y}) = R\,f(\mathbf{y})`.
Penalising deviations from this identity provides supervision *without
ground truth*. Combined with SSDU (Yaman 2020) it injects a second
source of signal that mitigates the chief weakness of SSDU at high
acceleration where the held-out partition Θ leaks too much information.

Formally:

.. math::
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{eq}} = \big\|\,f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(R\mathbf{y}) - R\,f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{y})\,\big\|_p.

The strategy is responsible for actually evaluating the network on
:math:`R\mathbf{y}` and supplying both branches via the loss
``context``.

    Forward expects:

    * ``prediction``: :math:`f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(R\mathbf{y})` —
      the network's reconstruction on the *transformed* measurement.
    * ``target``: ignored (the comparison signal lives in
      ``context``).
    * ``context["transformed_recon"]``: equivalently
      :math:`R\,f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{y})` — the same network
      evaluated on the original measurement, then transformed via the
      same group element :math:`R`.

    The loss simply measures :math:`\|prediction - transformed\_recon\|`.

    Strategies typically draw :math:`R` from a small set of discrete
    rotations / flips that commute with the Cartesian forward operator
    (90° rotations and axis flips are exact; translations require care
    near the FOV edges).
