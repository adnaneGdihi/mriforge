r"""Noise2Noise (N2N) — supervised denoising **without** clean targets.

Lehtinen *et al.* (2018) showed that, for zero-mean noise, the
expected-MSE-minimising denoiser

.. math::
    \hat{f} = \arg\min_f\,\mathbb{E}\,\|f(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\eta}_1)
        -(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\eta}_2)\|^2

equals the optimal supervised denoiser :math:`\arg\min_f
\mathbb{E}\,\|f(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\eta})-\mathbf{x}\|^2`. In other
words: regressing one noisy realisation against a *second independent*
noisy realisation is statistically as good as regressing against the
clean signal — provided the noise is independent and zero-mean.

The loss form is just MSE / L1 between ``prediction`` (the network
output on the *first* noisy realisation) and ``target`` (the *second*
noisy realisation). The work of producing two independent realisations
lives in the data pipeline / strategy; this loss is intentionally a
thin wrapper so it appears explicitly in YAML and so the registry can
stamp the right citation onto it.
