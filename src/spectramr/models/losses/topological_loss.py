    """Topological Loss based on Persistent Homology Approximation.

    Instead of full Cubical Complex calculation (which is computationally expensive),
    we approximate the 0-th order persistence (connected components) via
    differentiable Euler Characteristic (EC) on super-level sets.

    This penalizes the network if it hallucinates handles (b_1) or breaks components (b_0)
    relative to the topological structure of the target.
