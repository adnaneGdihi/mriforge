"""Cross-field translation losses (MICCAI MRIxFields2026).

``latent_cycle`` enforces encode-once / render-anywhere identifiability for the
:class:`AnatomyFieldRenderer` backbone: the latent re-extracted from a rendered
image must match the original latent. This is the empirical surrogate for the
nonlinear-ICA identifiability argument (the field index is the auxiliary variable)
that breaks the generic non-identifiability of single-view autoencoders.
