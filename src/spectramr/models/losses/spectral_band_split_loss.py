"""Spectral Band-Split Loss for Frequency-Selective Unpaired Translation.

Decomposes k-space into low-frequency (anatomy) and high-frequency (texture)
bands. Enforces hard data consistency on the low-frequency center while
applying Wasserstein adversarial matching only on the high-frequency periphery.

This prevents global structural hallucination by locking the macro-topology
from the ULF input, while focusing 100% of the adversarial capacity on
synthesizing realistic HF texture detail.

Mathematical Foundation:
    L = λ₁ ||M_low ⊙ (F(G(x_ulf)) - F(x_ulf))||₁
      + λ₂ W₁(M_high ⊙ F(G(x_ulf)), M_high ⊙ F(y_hf))
