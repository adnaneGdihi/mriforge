r"""Multi-axis classifier-free guidance (CFG) mixin.

Implements §8 of the multi-contrast brainstorm — generalises classifier-
free guidance [5] from a single binary condition to a *vector* of
condition axes :math:`\mathbf{c} = (c_{\text{contrast}}, c_{\text{thickness}},
c_{\text{pathology}}, \dots)`. Each axis is dropped independently during
training; at sampling time, the guidance is a weighted sum over per-axis
guidance directions:

.. math::

   \tilde{\boldsymbol\epsilon}
   \;=\;
   \boldsymbol\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}, \emptyset)
   \;+\;
   \sum_i w_i \big[
     \boldsymbol\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}, c_i)
     -\boldsymbol\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{x}, \emptyset)
   \big].

The advantage over single-axis CFG is independent dial knobs:
:math:`w_{\text{contrast}}` controls how strictly the output adheres to
the requested contrast, :math:`w_{\text{pathology}}` controls how
strongly any pathology mask is honoured, and so on. This is critical
when conditions can pull in opposite directions (e.g. a lesion-mask
condition that wants strong local edits vs. a contrast condition that
wants smooth brain-tissue priors).

The mixin is *model-side* — no diffusion-strategy edits required.
Models inherit ``MultiAxisCFGMixin`` and implement
``_predict_noise(x, conditions)`` where ``conditions`` is a dict of
``{"axis_name": tensor_or_None}``. The mixin provides:

- ``forward_with_cfg_drop(x, conditions, drop_probs)`` — training-time
  helper that masks out a subset of condition axes per sample.
- ``cfg_sample_step(x, conditions, weights)`` — inference-time
  combination of per-axis guidance.
