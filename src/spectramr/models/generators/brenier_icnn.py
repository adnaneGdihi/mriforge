"""Source-conditioned Brenier-form transport map (MICCAI MRIxFields2026, B-1.5).

A field-conditioned input-convex potential ``psi_b(x)``; its gradient has the FORM of a
Brenier map, so the synthesised 7T image ``T_b(x) = x + map_scale * grad_x psi_b(x)`` is a
convex-by-construction MONOTONE transport map (strictly monotone, near-identity at init). The
source field ``b`` conditions the potential (convexity-preserving gamma>=0/beta FiLM on the
convex path), so each source field has its own convex potential (Task 1); distinct from the
velocity ODE of B-3.1 and the learned latent render of B-3.8.

HONEST SCOPE: this is trained by paired L1 (the strategy), NOT the semi-dual OT objective.
The ARCHITECTURE guarantees a monotone (gradient-of-convex) map; it does NOT guarantee the
trained map is the W2-OPTIMAL Monge map between the source and 7T MARGINALS (that needs the OT
dual). And the map is curl-free (gradient of a scalar potential), which limits the
spatially-varying contrast changes it can express. We claim a convex-by-construction monotone
transport map, not measure/marginal optimality.

``model_kwargs.enforce_convexity=False`` drops the non-negative-weight constraint — the
potential is then a generic CNN whose gradient is NOT a guaranteed OT map (the one-knob
ablation, isolating the Brenier/convexity guarantee). Magnitude-only (1->1).

``model_kwargs.intensity_adaptation`` (``none`` | ``undamped`` | ``transfer``) lets the map adapt
INTENSITY/CONTRAST — the residual on co-registered, normalised source/7T pairs. ``none`` (default)
is the original mean-pooled map, pinned at identity; ``undamped`` sum-pools the potential so the
convex map can realise an EXPANSIVE intensity change; ``transfer`` composes a field-conditioned
monotone intensity transfer (``gain(b) < 1`` can COMPRESS contrast) while staying a monotone
Brenier map. See :class:`InputConvexNeuralNetwork` for the math and the one-knob ablation arms
``b15_brenier_intensity_undamped`` / ``b15_brenier_intensity_transfer`` (vs ``b15_brenier_map``).
