"""Which non-spatial axes each ``data.dataset_type`` exposes.

The workflow contract can only check "regime *X* needs a ``TEMPORAL`` axis but
this data has none" if it knows what axes a dataset carries. Datasets are
selected in configs by the ``data.dataset_type`` string, so these tables are
keyed off that string: the value that actually picks the data.

Keys are post-normalization values (the canonical-key contract)
==============================================================
``check_workflow_required_axes`` / ``check_workflow_spatial_rank`` read
``config.data.dataset_type`` off a **validated** ``DataConfigSchema``. That
field passes through :meth:`DataConfigSchema.validate_dataset_type`, which
lower-cases the raw YAML value, rewrites aliases to their canonical name, and
raises on anything left over. The only strings that can ever reach a lookup here
are therefore the canonical ones, which makes two kinds of key a dead rule:

* an **alias** key (``2d``, ``3d``, ``paired_nifti``, ``paired_mri``): the value
  is rewritten before the lookup, so the entry is never hit. ``dataset_type:
  2d`` arrives as ``image``.
* an **invalid** key (``slice``, ``volumetric``, ``reconstruction``): such a
  config raises at Tier 0 and never reaches the check at all.

Deleting an alias key costs no coverage, because its canonical target carries
the annotation. ``tests/unit/data/datasets/test_axis_exposure.py`` enforces this
by round-tripping every key of both tables through the real validator and
asserting it survives unchanged, so a dead key cannot be reintroduced silently.

Contract (mirrors the capability invariant): a ``dataset_type`` absent from a
table is **unannotated**, and the rule skips it rather than guessing. Only
annotate a ``dataset_type`` whose exposure is unambiguous. An absent key is
always safe; a wrong one is not.

Two routes, and the weaker one is the fallback
==============================================
Axes reach a rule by one of two routes, and they are not equal:

* **declared** (:func:`declared_axes_for`) -- a per-*arm* fact the config layer
  already validated: ``data.acquisition_axes`` (an explicit list, any
  dataset_type) unioned with ``data.bart.bart_dim_map`` (BART arms). This is the
  stronger claim and it wins.
* **annotated** (:func:`exposed_axes_for`) -- a per-*type* claim about a whole
  corpus, hand-written in ``DATASET_TYPE_AXES`` below, used when the arm
  declares nothing.

Some dataset types cannot be annotated at all, and ``bart_kspace`` is the worked
example: five of its arms declare an ``echo`` axis and three declare ``flip``, so
no single row is true for both. A per-type table cannot express a per-arm fact --
which is why those eight arms were invisible to
``check_workflow_required_axes`` until the declared route existed.

``data.acquisition_axes`` generalises that escape hatch beyond BART. The fact
``bart_dim_map`` encodes is not BART-specific, but its spelling was, so a
non-BART arm whose dataset_type has no truthful row had no way to state what it
acquires -- and simply annotating the row instead would have been the "wrong
key" this contract warns against, because the row generalises over a corpus
whose arms disagree.

Note what this does NOT do: a declaration says the arm's data carries an axis, it
does not make a loader preserve one. ``dataset_type: nifti`` still folds a 4-D
volume into channels and still exposes nothing, and declaring ``temporal`` on
such an arm would be a false claim rather than a fix -- the loader is the thing
to change, which is what ``fmri`` below is for.

    The companion to :func:`exposed_axes_for`, and the stronger of the two.
    ``exposed_axes_for`` reads an annotation about a ``dataset_type`` -- a claim
    about a whole corpus, written by hand in the table above. This reads a
    *per-arm declaration the config layer already validated*:
    ``data.bart.bart_dim_map``, which :class:`~spectramr.config.schemas.data.
    BartConfigSchema` requires to be non-empty when enabled, rejects unknown roles
    in, and refuses to let a non-singleton dimension go unnamed (pitfall #9).

    That difference is why ``bart_kspace`` has no row in ``DATASET_TYPE_AXES`` and
    cannot be given one: its axes are not a property of the dataset_type at all.
    The eight ``bart_kspace`` arms in this repo disagree with each other -- five
    declare ``echo`` (a dual-echo B0 acquisition), three declare ``flip``
    (double-angle B1) -- so any single static annotation would be wrong for one
    group. A per-type table cannot express a per-arm fact, which is what left
    those arms invisible to ``check_workflow_required_axes``: the one rule whose
    whole job is to consume exactly the fact they were declaring.

    Returns ``None`` -- "no declaration, fall back to the type table" -- rather
    than an empty set when the arm declares nothing, preserving the non-breaking
    skip invariant the rest of the axis system uses. An *enabled* dim map that
    happens to name only spatial roles does return ``frozenset()``, and that is
    deliberate: it is a positive declaration that the arm carries no non-spatial
    axis, which should reject a regime requiring one rather than skip.

    Limitation, stated rather than hidden: a role's *presence* is declared, its
    *extent* is not. ``bart_dim_map: {echo: 6}`` says dim 6 carries echoes; it
    cannot say how many. A rule needing "at least two echoes" is a data-level
