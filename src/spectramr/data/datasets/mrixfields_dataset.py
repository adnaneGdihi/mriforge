"""Multi-field, multi-contrast paired dataset for MICCAI MRIxFields2026.

Each travelling-volunteer subject is scanned at five field strengths
``{0.1, 1.5, 3, 5, 7}`` T with three contrasts (T1w / T2w / T2-FLAIR);
magnitude-only, MNI 0.5 mm, values in ``[0, 1]``. This dataset forms ordered
``(source @ b_s, target @ b_t)`` translation pairs *within* a ``pairing_group``
(default ``"{subject_id}|{contrast}"``) and emits BOTH field values so the
downstream strategy can condition the renderer on the target field (B-3.8 / B-1.9)
or integrate a velocity field along ``tau = log10(B0)`` (B-3.1, field-flow).

Data SSOT (CLAUDE.md #7 / #11): this module is the only place that turns a file
into samples; higher layers consume it via ``DataPipelineDirector``. The default
NIfTI loader is imported lazily so torch-less test collection still works and so
an injected ``image_loader`` (tests) bypasses disk entirely.

# (~20 GB, x the DataLoader workers) is an OOM — refused. This is the number of volumes a
# worker keeps decoded at once; ~226 MB each, so the default 6 is ~1.4 GB/worker.
#
# It is a BUDGET, not a hit-rate tuning knob. What makes ``all_slices`` affordable is
# pairing it with ``VolumeBlockedSliceSampler``, which orders the epoch so that the
# containers sharing a resident volume set are consumed together — the same
# load-a-few-volumes / emit-many-slices / shuffle-the-buffer algorithm ``tio.Queue``
# uses, expressed as a torch Sampler because this dataset emits plain dicts rather than
# ``tio.Subject`` (see the sampler's docstring for why the Queue itself cannot be used).
# Under that order one decode is amortised over every foreground slice of every container
# the volume participates in: a 5-field ``all_pairs`` group is 20 containers drawn from 5
# volumes, so 5 decodes serve ~5,000 samples.
#
# Without the sampler a shuffled loader visits each (container, slice) in random order and
# NO attainable budget gives intra-epoch reuse over the ~45-volume / ~10 GB working set —
# which is what made an unordered ``all_slices`` a starvation trap.
#
# The floor is the per-``__getitem__`` working set: ``_getitem_multi_source`` touches N
# sources PLUS the target, so the corpus' four source fields need 5 resident at once. A
# budget of 4 against that is a cyclic access of period 5 over capacity 4 — a hit rate of
# exactly ZERO. ``test_volume_budget_exceeds_worst_case_working_set`` pins the

            stacking policies -- ``_TUPLE_POLICIES``, which owns that set -- because the
            stack axis on top of a volume would emit a 5-D tensor no strategy consumes,
            and it raises for those.
        transform: optional ``tio.Compose`` (or any tio transform). Applied via
            ``_apply_transform``, which wraps the image keys in a ``tio.Subject``
            first — a raw dict makes TorchIO raise (see that method's docstring).
        image_loader: injectable loader ``path -> Tensor`` (tests); defaults to
            the real NIfTI IO strategy. For ``central`` the default reads only the
            central slice; for ``all_slices`` / ``volume`` it reads the whole volume
            (an injected loader is used unchanged for every mode — it returns the whole
            (small) test volume, from which the requested slice(s) are selected).

        min-max renorm. That renorm alone would amplify a faint-noise air slice to full

        ``rescale=False`` (the ``mrixfields_rescale_per_image`` default) SKIPS that
        renorm and keeps the corpus's own global ``[0, 1]`` scale. Field translation
        learns how intensity maps from one B0 to another, and renormalising the source

        the model is handed a source pre-scaled to the target's range, so the objective
        degenerates toward structure matching. The module docstring already records that
        this corpus is ``[0, 1]`` on disk, so the renorm converts a MEANINGFUL global
        scale into an arbitrary per-image one rather than establishing a scale.

        The cost is larger under ``all_slices`` than it was under ``central``: with one
        slice per volume the gain was at least comparable across samples, but stretching
        each of ~364 depth slices independently amplifies a low-dynamic-range slice near
        the top of the head to the same ``[0, 1]`` as mid-brain — a per-slice gain the
        network cannot invert because nothing in the batch records it. The ``clamp``
