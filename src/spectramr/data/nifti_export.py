"""Export a volume to NIfTI for SynthSeg: real voxel spacing, slice axis pinned.

SynthSeg reads NIfTI, not HDF5, and until now nothing in this repo could produce one --
``build_synthseg_region_cache.py --emit-synthseg-cmd`` printed a command pointing SynthSeg
at a directory of ``.h5`` files it cannot open. This module is the missing half.

Two facts make it load-bearing rather than plumbing.

**The affine is not decoration -- SynthSeg resamples with it.** ``FastMRIH5Strategy``
returns ``affine = np.eye(4)`` for every h5, because an h5 carries no spatial information.
Hand SynthSeg an identity affine for a 16x320x320 stack and it reads that volume as 16 mm
through-plane by 320 mm in-plane, up-samples the slice axis ~5x, and segments a brain that
was never acquired. It does not fail: it emits a confident, plausible label map, and every
tissue metric downstream is a number about anatomy that does not exist (pitfall #16). So
the spacing comes from the ISMRMRD header or the export **raises**. There is no 1 mm
default, because a wrong default here is undetectable in the output.

**The stored array is a CROP of what the header describes.** ``reconstruction_rss`` is
fastMRI's centre crop of the scanner reconstruction -- 320x320 for brain -- while
``reconSpace`` reports the *uncropped* recon matrix and field of view. A crop changes the
extent, not the voxel size, so spacing is ``fieldOfView_mm / matrixSize`` from the header's
own pair and never ``fieldOfView_mm / array_size``. Getting that backwards inflates every
in-plane spacing by ``recon_matrix / 320`` and, because SynthSeg resamples with the affine,
returns a plausible segmentation of a brain at the wrong physical scale. The spacing is
recorded per volume and re-checked after segmentation by :func:`check_label_spacing` --
shape checks alone cannot see this class of error.

**The array order is a contract with the cache, not a preference.** ``RegionMaskCache``
indexes ``vol[slice_index]`` (``mask_cache.py``) -- axis 0 is slices -- and the image slice
the metric grades is ``f["reconstruction_rss"][i]``, also axis 0. So an exported volume is
``[S, H, W]``, slice **first**, and SynthSeg hands the order back untouched (it saves the
segmentation with the input's own affine and header, realigned to the input's array order).
Note this is the *opposite* of the ``(W, H, D)`` order ``NiftiStrategy``'s docstring
ascribes to the pre-existing brain/prostate NIfTIs. That docstring describes those files;
it is not a law, and ``NiftiStrategy`` transposes nothing. Get the order backwards and every
"tissue mask" is a sagittal cut through the volume, mis-registered against the axial slice
it is scored on -- while the run stays green.

    export -> segment -> cache chain compares **shapes**: ``write_slice_first_nifti``
    checks the array against the geometry's shape, ``verify_slice_first_nifti`` reads
    the file back and compares *values*, and ``check_label_grid`` compares the label
    shape. The affine is compared by none of them -- yet SynthSeg resamples to 1 mm
    using exactly that affine, so a wrong spacing yields a confident segmentation of a
    brain at the wrong physical scale, on the right grid, with a clean QC row.

    ``rtol`` is deliberately tight. This is not a numerical-tolerance question: the
    failure it guards is spacing wrong by the crop ratio (320/recon_matrix, tens of
    percent), never by an ulp.

    not, the segmenter silently handed us a different sampling of space -- and the cache
