"""TorchIO intensity-augmentation adapters.

TorchIO ships ``RandomGamma``, ``RandomNoise``, ``RandomBlur`` and
``RandomBiasField``, so :mod:`spectramr.data.transforms.augmentation_factory`
uses those directly.  It does **not** ship brightness/contrast jitter, and the
project's own :class:`~spectramr.data.transforms.realistic_degradations.RicianNoise`
and :class:`~spectramr.data.transforms.realistic_degradations.MotionBlur3D` are
``nn.Module``\\s that speak ``[B, C, D, H, W]``, not TorchIO subjects.  This
module supplies the four missing pieces as thin ``tio.Transform`` adapters.

The two MRI-physics adapters **wrap** the existing modules rather than
reimplementing them (non-negotiable 16: prefer wiring over rewriting).  The
degradation maths stays in ``realistic_degradations``; only the layout bridge
and the subject iteration live here.

Layout contract
---------------
TorchIO stores image data as ``[C, W, H, D]`` with no batch axis.  Adapters
that hand tensors to an ``nn.Module`` therefore permute to ``[1, C, D, H, W]``
and back; ``permute(0, 3, 2, 1)`` is its own inverse between the two 4-D
layouts, which is why the same call appears on both sides.

Complex data
------------
None of these adapters is defined on complex tensors — Rician noise and gamma
both assume a magnitude image.  The complex guard lives in the **factory**, not
here, so there is exactly one owner for the decision (non-negotiable 17).
