"""Stable, deterministic signatures for TorchIO transform chains.

Phase 2 of ``TODO/audit/data_layer_unification_plan.md`` introduces a
**transform parity contract**: inference must use the same transform
chain that produced the training data, modulo augmentations. The
mechanism is a stable hash recorded in the checkpoint at training
time, then re-computed at inference time and diffed.

The signature is a short hex string derived from:

- Each transform's class name (canonical, not instance ``repr``).
- A small set of "load-bearing" kwargs per transform — the ones that
  meaningfully change the output (e.g. ``out_min_max`` for
  ``RescaleIntensity``, ``percentiles`` for normalization). Stochastic
  state (RNG seeds, augmentation probabilities) is intentionally
  excluded — augmentations are expected to differ between train and
  infer, and asserting equality on a probability would always trip.

Design notes:

- **Order matters.** Two chains with the same transforms but reordered
  produce different signatures — which is correct, since reordering
  normalization vs. resampling changes the output.
- **Augmentation classes are dropped from the signature.** The parity
  contract asserts "train transforms minus augmentation == infer
  transforms"; we exclude aug classes from both sides before hashing.
- **Forward-compatible.** When a new transform with new kwargs lands,
  it shows up in the signature automatically via its class name. Only
  if its behavior depends on a non-default kwarg do we need to add it
  to ``_LOAD_BEARING_KWARGS``.
