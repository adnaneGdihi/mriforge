"""Deterministic file-level train/val index splitting (data SSOT).

One honest split helper shared by every dataset instantiator and manifest
loader so the single-file edge case is handled identically everywhere instead
of drifting into three different wrong behaviours (silent leak, empty train,
warn-and-leak). File-level (never slice-level) splitting avoids the subtler
leak where slices of the same volume land in both train and val.

Policy:

- ``validation_split <= 0`` -> train-only: every item is training, validation
  is empty. This is the explicit escape hatch for single-file smoke / overfit
  sanity runs; set ``validation_split: 0`` in the config to opt in.
- exactly one item with ``validation_split > 0`` -> **raise**. A one-file
  corpus cannot form a train/val split that does not overlap: reusing the file
  for both leaks validation into training, and holding it out empties the
  training set. The caller must supply >= 2 files or choose the train-only
  escape hatch above.
- otherwise -> deterministic non-overlapping split with the last ``n_val``
  items as validation, clamped so ``1 <= n_val <= n - 1`` (both splits
  non-empty).

    The **test set is carved out first**, from the tail, and the validation
    fraction is then applied to what remains. Two consequences worth stating,
    because both are easy to get silently wrong:

    * val and test are disjoint by construction -- applying both fractions to the
      whole index independently would overlap them, and an overlap between the
      set you tune on and the set you report is the one leak a held-out split
      exists to prevent;
    * ``validation_split`` keeps meaning "of the training pool", so an arm that
      adds a test set does not silently shrink its validation set as well.

    ``test_split <= 0`` returns an empty test list and delegates entirely to
    :func:`split_index`, so an arm that declares no test set behaves exactly as
    before -- there is no third split unless one was asked for.

    The 2026-09 cohort review found the directory-route splits (BIDS and plain

    subject's ``T1w`` could train while its ``T2w`` validated -- the same
    anatomy on both sides, which is the leak a held-out split exists to
    prevent. Grouping by subject before splitting is the fix; a file whose

    splits exactly as before.
