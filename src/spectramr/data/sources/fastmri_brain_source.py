"""fastMRI brain volume source: manifest-driven, QC-gated, region-attached.

Five gates, all of which have to pass before a slice reaches the sweep:

1. **The fastMRI+ manifest's QC must be approved**, and the approval must still describe
   the manifest it sits in. A wrong y-origin flips every lesion box into mirror-image
   normal tissue and yields a confident, meaningless null; the matched control mirrors
   with it, so nothing downstream can detect the flip.
2. **The acquisition attr must agree with the filename token**, and a record whose
   filename yields no single token is **counted** as it is dropped -- never silently
   skipped. Past :data:`MAX_CONTRAST_DROP_RATE` the survivors are a selection rather than
   the cohort, and the source refuses.
3. **A box must be a lesion to enter the lesion region.** ``"Possible artifact"`` (505
   boxes) and ``"Normal variant"`` (73) are not pathology, and ``"Paranasal sinus
   opacification"`` (40) is not on brain. See
   :data:`~spectramr.data.annotations.fastmri_plus_classes.NON_PARENCHYMAL_GROUPS`.
4. **A box must be ON brain to enter the lesion region** -- measured against SynthSeg, at
   :data:`MIN_LESION_BRAIN_COVERAGE`, because the label alone cannot tell a craniotomy on
   the skull flap from a resection cavity in parenchyma.
5. **The tissue axis must be sound** before any ``tissue:*`` region is attached -- but a
   SynthSeg failure does not block the pathology axis.

Every exclusion is counted and stamped into the slice's provenance. A box or a record
that quietly vanished would be a cohort change with no record of itself.

The AXT1 / AXT1POST prefix trap
--------------------------------
fastMRI brain acquisitions are ``AXT1``, ``AXT1PRE``, ``AXT1POST``, ``AXT2``,
``AXFLAIR``. **"AXT1" is a prefix of both "AXT1PRE" and "AXT1POST"**, so a
substring test (``"AXT1" in filename``) matches all three and silently labels
every post-contrast scan as pre-contrast.

That would not crash. It would merge three *different* contrasts into one cell of
the leaderboard's anatomy axis -- the axis whose entire purpose is to separate
them. So the filename is split into underscore tokens and matched **exactly**.

``io_strategies.FastMRIH5Strategy`` already carries ``f.attrs`` (which holds
``acquisition``) into ``result["metadata"]``, and until now **nothing read it**.
This source reads it, cross-checks it against the filename token, and **raises on
disagreement** -- a file whose header and name disagree about its contrast is one
whose provenance is broken, and guessing which to believe is exactly the silent
fallback the repo forbids (pitfall #9).

The pooled region only means anything if its contralateral mirror is a valid control:
same size, same anatomy, no lesion. ``matched_control._accept`` already demands the
**control** be >=95% brain. Accepting a *lesion* box at any coverage while holding the
control to 95% makes the two arms incomparable in the one property the control exists to
hold fixed -- so the lesion is gated too.

Measured, not assumed, because the taxonomy genuinely cannot call it: ``POSTSURGICAL``
holds both craniotomy (on the skull flap -- mirror is intact skull, useless) and
resection cavity (in parenchyma -- mirror is normal brain, exactly right). One label,
two answers. Brain coverage separates them; a group name cannot. See
