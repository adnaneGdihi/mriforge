"""Which ``dataset_type`` values deliver k-space rather than images.

One home for a fact that decides real behaviour and was previously a
function-local constant inside ``infrastructure/validation/spec_card.py`` —
unreachable from the data layer, which must not import ``infrastructure/``
(non-negotiable #5).

The distinction is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. ``subject["input"]`` means
opposite things across it: on an image arm it is an image, on a k-space arm it
IS the k-space. Any transform that resolves its source by key name has to know
which, or it will silently treat measured k-space as an image — which is exactly
how ``PhysicsSynchronization`` came to apply a second forward FFT to it
(audit A4).
