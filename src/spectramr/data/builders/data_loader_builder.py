"""DDP loader rewrap helper (data-builders SSOT for DataLoader construction).

This module used to also house a ``DataLoaderBuilder`` / ``DataLoaderBuildConfig``
/ ``build_data_loaders`` trio. That surface had **zero production callers** —
the live train/val loader path is ``infrastructure/training/builders/DataBuilder``
via ``DataPipelineDirector``, and the same-named fluent builder in
``infrastructure/builders/leaf/data_builders.py`` is a different class — so it
was pruned in the 2026-06 data-pipeline audit (deletion pinned by
``tests/unit/data/builders/test_data_loader_builder.py``). Its ``shuffle`` /
``drop_last`` knobs were also unread (the methods hardcoded their own values),
making them pitfall-#15 silent no-ops.

Only :func:`wrap_with_distributed_sampler` is consumed (``pipelines/parallel.py``).

    """Return a new ``DataLoader`` that wraps ``loader``'s dataset with a ``DistributedSampler``.

    PyTorch does not expose a public way to swap a sampler on an existing
    ``DataLoader``, so reconstructing the loader is the canonical pattern.
    This helper lives in the data-builders subtree (CLAUDE.md pitfall #11)
    so pipelines code can wrap loaders for DDP without instantiating
    ``DataLoader`` directly. Phase 4 of
    ``TODO/backlog_ssot_and_layering_cleanup.md``.

    Args:
        loader: The non-distributed loader to rewrap.
        shuffle: Whether the distributed sampler should shuffle.

    Returns:
        A new ``DataLoader`` with ``DistributedSampler`` attached, preserving
        the source loader's batch size, workers, pin-memory, drop-last,
        collate, worker-init, and persistent-workers settings.
