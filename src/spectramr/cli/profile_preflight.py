"""Refuse a profiling run that cannot succeed, before Scalene starts.

``spectramr profile --target train`` pays for the entire training environment —
data pipeline, model build, DI container, first loader batch — before the
training loop reaches either of the two conditions checked here. On the arm that
motivated this module that was **11.5 minutes** to a ``ConfigurationError``.

The wasted time is the smaller half of the problem. Scalene profiles the process
it launched, so a child that dies at minute twelve still produces a
``scalene-profile.json`` — a syntactically valid profile of environment
construction and nothing else, sitting in a properly-named directory beside a
manifest. Nothing about that artifact says "this run never trained"; you find
out by reading ``outcome.exit_code``. A profile that is wrong rather than absent
is exactly the shape non-negotiable 3 exists to prevent, so the refusal happens
up front, in about a second, with no directory created.

Both checks are **reused verdicts, never restated ones** (non-negotiable 17):

* the process-group requirement is asked of the strategy plugins themselves via
  :attr:`~spectramr.infrastructure.distributed.strategy_registry.ParallelStrategyPlugin.requires_process_group`,
  so a backend added tomorrow answers for itself. Spelling it here as
  ``strategy != "none"`` would be a second owner *and* wrong: ``dp`` is
  ``nn.DataParallel``, genuinely single-process, and profiles fine.
* the validation-gate arithmetic is :func:`spectramr.pipelines.train.validation_can_fire`
  — the same predicate the loop consults — so the pre-flight verdict and the
  runtime verdict cannot drift apart.
