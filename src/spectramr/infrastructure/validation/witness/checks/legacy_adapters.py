"""Adapters that republish the three pre-existing check stacks as witnesses.

Nothing is rewritten. `ConfigHealthChecker` keeps its 126 methods,
`ValidatorRegistry` keeps its 17+ rules, `compatibility_matrix` keeps its
`_RULES` list. Each is wrapped once so a single gate can run all three, which is
the actual fix for the split:

* ``bootstrap.build_container`` ran ``ValidatorRegistry`` only — it had never run
  ``ConfigHealthChecker``, so a config could start training with health findings
  nothing had looked at,
* ``cli/app.py::_audit_one`` ran ``ConfigHealthChecker`` + ``compatibility_matrix``
  only, with zero references to ``get_validator_registry`` — so the audit could
  pass a config that `train` would then reject at startup.

Both directions were real, which is why this is not "the audit is a superset of
train". Two stacks that never compare notes is the ``META`` failure class: each
looks thorough, and the union is what nobody checked.

Subject kinds are what let one gate serve both. The registry adapter reads the
raw dict, the other two need resolved settings, and the gate only schedules a
witness whose subjects the surface can actually provide.
