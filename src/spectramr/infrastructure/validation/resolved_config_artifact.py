"""The resolved-config artifact: one definition, owned by the audit layer.

``resolved_config.json`` answers "what did this config actually resolve to, and
what did the declaration lose on the way there?". That is an **audit** question,
so the artifact is defined here rather than inside the training pipeline, and both
surfaces call this module:

* ``cli/app.py::_audit_one`` emits it pre-flight, before any GPU time is spent,
* ``pipelines/train.py`` deposits a copy in the run directory, so a bundle stays
  self-describing without the audit having to have been run.

Why the definition moved out of ``train.py``. The audit resolves a config through
exactly the same ``_finalize_from_dict`` path as training, so it *computes* every
substitution the ledger records and then threw them all away, because the audit
had no output file: its report goes to stdout, and under ``--json`` to a pipe. The
one surface whose entire job is to catch problems before a run was the one leaving
no artifact, so a config's drops were only discoverable after committing to the
run. Meanwhile the shape lived in a hand-rolled dict inside the pipeline, where
the audit could not reach it.

Two surfaces hand-rolling the same artifact is how the two disjoint validation
stacks happened (``bootstrap`` runs one validator set, ``_audit_one`` another,
neither aware of the other). One producer cannot drift from itself.

**Train still writes its copy.** Making the audit the *only* writer would break
``infrastructure/reporting/cohort_ablation.py::_read_resolved_config``, which
reads ``<arm_dir>/resolved_config.json`` out of run output directories, and would
leave any un-audited run with no record of its own configuration.
