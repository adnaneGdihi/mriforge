"""Parallel-strategy plugins: one registry, two ordered hooks.

Replaces ``pipelines.parallel.apply_parallelism``, whose ``if/elif/else raise``
implemented ``none``/``dp``/``ddp`` while FSDP was reached through a *separate*
``parallel.fsdp.enabled`` flag read in ``ModelBuilder.build()``. So
``strategy: 'fsdp'`` -- the spelling the reference template advertised -- raised
``ValueError`` **after** the whole training environment had been built, while
``strategy: 'none'`` + ``fsdp.enabled: true`` silently sharded.

The ordering is the load-bearing part, and it is not symmetric:

.. code-block:: text

    ModelBuilder: build -> compile -> EMA
      Stage A: prepare_models(models, ctx)
          SyncBatchNorm, FSDP wrap
    OptimizationBuilder: optimizers / schedulers
      Stage B: adopt(models, optimizers, schedulers, ctx)
          DataParallel / DDP wrap, DistributedSampler

**FSDP must be Stage A.** ``FSDP.__init__`` flattens parameters into a shard and
re-points their storage. An optimizer built before that holds parameters whose
storage was swapped underneath it: gradients arrive shard-shaped against
full-shape ``exp_avg``, which is a shape error on the first step -- or, on the
``foreach`` path, a silently wrong update. Full-size optimizer state would also
defeat the memory saving FSDP exists for.

**DDP must not move to Stage A.** It would work -- DDP does not change parameter
identity -- but every downstream consumer that expects a bare module
(``count_parameters``, the optimizer builder's model selection) would then see a
``DistributedDataParallel``.

Registration is an explicit table rather than a decorator scan: there are five
strategies, they are a closed vocabulary in the schema, and a plugin that fails
to import must be a loud error rather than a name that quietly resolves to
nothing.
