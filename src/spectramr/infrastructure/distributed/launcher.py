"""Distributed launcher (PR-14 / L1) — campaign-aware.

Plan: TODO/backlog_paradigm_expansion_roadmap.md §PR-14.

Two entry points:

- :func:`launch_distributed` — spawns ``num_devices × num_nodes``
  worker processes via ``torch.multiprocessing.spawn`` (single-node)
  or returns the ``torchrun`` command line (multi-node).
- :func:`dispatch_for_campaign` — invoked by the campaign runner with
  the resolved per-arm parallelism config; chooses single-process,
  single-node multi-GPU, or multi-node based on
  ``num_nodes`` / ``num_devices``.

The launcher is deliberately *generic* — it does not import any
strategy / model class. Callers pass a ``run_fn`` that takes
``(rank, world_size, settings)`` and the launcher handles process-
group setup + clean teardown.
