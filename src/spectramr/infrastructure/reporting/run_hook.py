"""The end-of-run reporting hook, shared by every verb that produces a run dir.

This lived inside ``pipelines/train.py`` and was reachable only from training,
which is why ``report`` could not follow ``infer``/``predict``: the hook was in
the wrong building, not missing. Nothing in it is training-specific -- it reads
``config.reporting`` and ``config.run.seed`` duck-typed and hands a run directory
to ``generate_report``, which is itself entirely artifact-driven.

It is moved here rather than imported across pipelines because
``pipelines/infer.py`` importing ``pipelines/train.py`` would make the inference
verb depend on the training verb for a capability that belongs to neither -- it
belongs to reporting. Both pipelines now call inward, which is the direction the
layering rule requires anyway.

``pipelines/train.py`` re-exports these under their former private names, so the
existing call sites and the source-text pins that guard this hook's behaviour
keep resolving to this definition (``inspect.getsource`` follows the object, not
the module it is read through).
