"""Algebraic Null-Space Erasure — Orthogonal Marker Removal.

Projects corrupted images onto the orthogonal complement (null-space)
of the marker's known spatial basis, annihilating marker energy without
altering the linearly independent anatomical signal.

Mathematics:
    Given marker spatial basis :math:`M \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times K}` and
    corrupted measurement :math:`Y = X_{anat} + M_{corrupted}`:

    .. math::

        P^{\\perp} = I - M (M^H M + \\epsilon I)^{-1} M^H

        X_{clean} = P^{\\perp} Y

    The Tikhonov term :math:`\\epsilon I` regularises the pseudo-inverse
    for numerical stability.

Reference:
    Standard linear algebra — Moore-Penrose orthogonal projection.
