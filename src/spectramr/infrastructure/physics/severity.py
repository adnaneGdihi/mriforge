"""Declared severity ranges for the digital-twin degradations (the SSOT).

Every degradation is driven by a dimensionless severity ``theta in [0, 1]``. What
that ``theta`` *means physically* — 40 dB SNR down to 2 dB, acceleration R = 1 to
8, a 30-pixel peak displacement — was until now trapped inside each degrader as a
literal (``sigma = 4.0 * theta + 1e-3``), sometimes with the reasoning in a code
comment and nowhere else.

That makes a simple question unanswerable: *"what noise range did this sweep
actually cover?"* You cannot report a severity axis you have not written down, and
a sweep whose physical range lives only in a function body cannot be put in a
table, a paper, or a caption.

This module declares it once. :class:`SeveritySpec` hangs off every
:class:`~spectramr.infrastructure.physics.digital_twin_extensions.DegradationSpec`,
and is the single source for both the sweep's theta grid and the reported
physical range.

Two things this deliberately does **not** paper over:

* **Direction is not always "up".** ``complex_gaussian`` ramps SNR from 40 dB
  (clean) down to 2 dB (worst). Its *physical minimum* is the **most degraded**
  end. Reporting a bare "min / max" column would invert the reader's
  interpretation, so the fields are named ``at_theta_min`` / ``at_theta_max`` —
  by severity, never by magnitude. :attr:`SeveritySpec.direction` states it.

* **Some degradations move more than one knob.** ``rigid_motion`` ramps
  translation *and* rotation together; ``iq_ghost`` ramps a DC offset *and* an I/Q
  imbalance. The severity axis is still one-dimensional (that is fine — it is a
  severity ramp, not an ablation), but the co-varying parameters are declared
  rather than hidden behind whichever one happened to get reported.

    """Shape a normalised diffusion progress ``ratio`` into a severity ratio.

    The counterpart of ``KSpaceAccelerator._normalized_progress`` for degradation
    severity: undersampling already ramps R over timesteps under a declared
    schedule, and this is the same ramp for the ``DEGRADATION_REGISTRY`` axes.
    It shares the schedule vocabulary (``AccelerationSchedule``) rather than
    minting a parallel one -- two enums with the same members is how two
    spellings of one concept begin.

    ``linear`` returns ``ratio`` UNCHANGED, by early return rather than by
    computing ``ratio ** 1.0``. It is the default, every existing digital-twin
    arm routes through it, and a last-bit difference here would silently move a
    corrupted volume with nothing to attribute it to.

    ``step`` is binary at the midpoint. Undersampling's ``step`` indexes an
    explicit ``acceleration_range`` LIST and falls back to base/max when none was
    declared; severity has no list, only the ``(vmin, vmax)`` pair, so only that
    fallback has a meaning here -- 0 below the midpoint, 1 above.

    Args:
        ratio: normalised progress in [0, 1] (``t / (T - 1)``, or the twin's
            ``corruption_factor``). Values outside are clamped: a caller passing
            t > T should not silently get a severity above the declared maximum.
        schedule: an ``AccelerationSchedule`` value.
        power: exponent for ``power_law`` / ``polynomial``.

        The shaped ratio in [0, 1], to be remapped onto the axis's declared
        ``(vmin, vmax)`` by the caller.
