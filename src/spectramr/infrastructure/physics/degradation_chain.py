"""An ordered, compounded degradation chain with a fixed severity per axis.

The chain is the fitted object: ``[(axis, theta), ...]``. Its severities are emitted
as DEGENERATE ``degradation_ranges`` -- ``(theta, theta)`` -- which is what pins an
axis to a constant regardless of the diffusion corruption factor, because
:meth:`DigitalTwinSimulator._get_effective_cf` returns ``vmin + (vmax - vmin) * eff``.
That is the whole reason this module introduces no new runtime degradation path: a
fitted chain replays through the already-wired simulator as ordinary config.

Chain ORDER is not free. The simulator runs its native pipeline first and registry
axes afterwards in list order, so a chain is a *declared axis set* whose severities
are fitted; orderings are never searched.
