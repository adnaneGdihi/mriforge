"""Acquisition parameters, and the SNR prior they imply for a quality match.

The ISMRMRD header records how a scan was acquired: field strength, echo and
repetition time, receiver bandwidth, averages. Those numbers *predict* part of the
quality gap between two cohorts, so they belong in the fit as a physically-derived
warm start rather than being ignored while a derivative-free search rediscovers them
from a sharpness statistic.

.. note::
   ``spectramr.data.profiler._parse_ismrmrd_xml`` also reads this header. It is
   deliberately not reused: it is *tolerant* (an unparseable header yields ``None``
   fields so a survey can continue), and it extracts a different set (vendor, coils,
   matrix) without TR or bandwidth. A silently ``None`` field strength here would
   degrade the prior invisibly, so this parser raises on malformed XML and reports a
   genuinely absent field as ``None`` -- a fact, not a failure.
