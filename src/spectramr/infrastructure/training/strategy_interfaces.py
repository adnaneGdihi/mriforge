    """Who owns the backward pass, the optimizer step, and their bookkeeping.

    ``backward_and_step`` has been the de-facto seam of the training loop for a
    long time -- ``StepExecutor.execute_step`` calls it exactly once and nothing
    else drives an optimizer -- but it was never declared anywhere. It was an
    undeclared interface with one implementation, which is fine right up until a
    second thing needs to own the step.

    Two such things do. A **sharded/engine-owned** backend (DeepSpeed) performs
    its own loss scaling, gradient accumulation and ``zero_grad`` inside
    ``engine.backward``/``engine.step``; running the executor's versions as well
    gives 1/N^2 loss scaling and one real step per N^2 micro-batches. **SAM**
    needs two forward+backward passes, so it needs the closure rather than a
    computed loss. Declaring the seam is what lets those arrive as injected
    objects instead of ``if backend == ...`` branches in the loop.

    The two capability flags exist so the executor can ask "do you already do
    this?" rather than test a backend name:

    ``owns_gradient_accumulation``
        The policy divides the loss and decides accumulation boundaries itself.
        The executor must then NOT divide, and must treat every micro-batch as a
        step.
    ``owns_zero_grad``
        The policy zeroes gradients inside its own step. The executor must not.

    Defaults are ``False``, so an existing policy that declares neither behaves
    exactly as before.

        ``clip_grad_norm_`` does NOT clamp, so ``optimizer.step()`` permanently
        poisons the weights. Under AMP the scaler already skips inf/nan steps, so
        this defers to it and avoids the per-step device sync.
