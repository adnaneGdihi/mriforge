"""One decompression step for every k-space *visualization* path (#682).

``data.processing.enable_log_scaling`` compresses k-space magnitude with
``m -> log1p(m)`` (``data/transforms/normalization.py::compress_kspace_log``).
The inverse, :func:`decompress_kspace_log`, had exactly ONE caller in the tree --
inside the diffusion strategy, gated on ``is_cold_diffusion`` -- so every other
arm inverse-FFT'd the *compressed* spectrum.

That is not a scaled image. ``log1p`` is a per-bin nonlinearity, so it reweights
the spectrum before the transform: the low-|k| bins that carry contrast are
squashed toward the high-|k| bins that carry noise, and the IFFT of the result is
a high-pass-like artifact dominated by whatever DC survives. The render looks like
a plausible-but-wrong reconstruction, which is why it went unnoticed -- the
snapshot is *supposed* to show something odd early in training.

This module exists so the step is written once. `debug_snapshot` in particular
cannot reach it any other way: it receives ``config.logging`` and has no access to
``config.data`` at all, which is why the flag is threaded in as an argument rather
than read here.

    what the caller passed, rather than applying ``expm1`` to a tensor that was
    never compressed (which would blow the dynamic range apart).

    A no-op when ``log_scaled`` is False, so every call site can invoke it
    unconditionally instead of repeating the branch.

    ``log_scaled`` is a *declaration*, and this verifies it against the tensor
    before acting on it. The two can disagree -- ``data.processing`` says the arm
    compresses k-space, but a given snapshot may have captured a tensor from the
    uncompressed side of that transform -- and acting on the declaration alone is
    what rendered ``experiment_11_attention_none``'s ground truth as an edge map:
    ``expm1`` under the ``DECOMPRESS_MAGNITUDE_CEILING`` clamp collapses every
    coefficient above the ceiling to the SAME magnitude while phase survives, so
    the IFFT draws a phase-only reconstruction with no low-frequency content.

    **Do not "fix" a bad render by narrowing the caller's ``log_scaled_keys``**
    (e.g. passing ``set()`` for ``diffusion_step`` in ``strategies/base.py``).
    That tag's tensors are post-normalization *by design*, so once the arm's
    normalization actually runs they WILL be compressed and all-keys ``expm1``
    becomes the correct behaviour. Narrowing the key set fixes today's pictures
    and silently re-introduces #682 later; the magnitude check below is what
    distinguishes the two cases at the moment of rendering, every time.

        x: Complex or real-stacked interleaved k-space.
