"""Optimizer resolution SSOT — the structural peer of :mod:`scheduler_resolution`.

One place turns an ``OptimizationConfigSchema`` into a concrete optimizer, so
there is exactly one answer to "which knobs reach torch?".

There used to be two dispatch mechanisms and the live path used the wrong one.
:class:`~spectramr.infrastructure.training.optimizer_registry.OptimizerRegistry`
was built to be the SSOT — its own docstring says so — but nothing routed
through it; the leaf ``OptimizerBuilder`` did a reflective
``getattr(torch.optim, name)`` instead, and then hand-picked which kwargs to
forward:

    if canonical_name in ("Adam", "AdamW"):
        opt_kwargs["betas"] = self._betas

``beta1``/``beta2`` were set unconditionally by the caller, so for **nadam,
radam and adamax** — all of which accept ``betas`` — they were silently dropped.
``weight_decay`` went the other way, forwarded unconditionally, so ``lbfgs`` and
``sparseadam`` (which accept none) would ``TypeError``.

That hand-maintained tuple is the defect, not a detail: it was correct when
written and became wrong the moment three more optimizers were registered.

**Kwarg forwarding is therefore signature-driven**, and the repo already trusts
introspection on this exact object — ``_unconsumed_optimizer_kwargs`` validates
``optimizer_kwargs`` against ``inspect.signature(cls.__init__)``. Until now the
two disagreed: one validated against the signature, the other forwarded against
a tuple.

Two guards keep "signature-driven" from becoming a rubber stamp:

1. A ``**kwargs`` in the signature would accept everything, so an optimizer with
   ``VAR_KEYWORD`` must declare its accepted set explicitly on
   ``@register_optimizer(..., params=frozenset({...}))``.
2. Filtering decides only what to *forward*, never what to *ignore*. The split
   is on ``model_fields_set`` — what the YAML actually said:

   ===========================  =====================================
   knob origin                  unaccepted by the optimizer
   ===========================  =====================================
   explicitly declared          **raises**
   left at its schema default   dropped, recorded at ``info``
   ===========================  =====================================

   So ``optimizer_type: lbfgs`` quietly drops the default ``weight_decay`` it
   cannot take, while ``optimizer_type: lbfgs`` *with* ``weight_decay: 0.01``
   raises rather than pretending to honour it.
