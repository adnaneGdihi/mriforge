"""Adaptive-conditioning seam shared by all training strategies (2026-05-26).

Lifts the FiLM ``AdaptiveConditioner`` wiring out of
``ConcreteVirtualFiducialStrategy`` so any strategy can adapt to its declared
condition sources (degradation severity, diffusion timestep, contrast, and the
domain axes field-strength / scanner / site). A strategy:

1. declares ``_SUPPORTED_CONDITION_SOURCES`` — the ``ConditioningContext``
   sources it can actually populate;
2. calls ``self._ensure_conditioner(n_channels)`` on first forward to lazily
   build the conditioner and register its params with the generator optimizer;
3. builds a ``ConditioningContext`` — ``_domain_conditioning_context(batch)``
   covers the standard exposed domain axes (``field_strength`` / ``scanner_id``
   / ``site_id`` / ``contrast_id``); strategies add their own (severity,
   diffusion_t, …).

The FiLM head is zero-init, so mixing this in is the identity until the
conditioner learns — no host model is perturbed. Mounted on
``BaseTrainingStrategy`` so every strategy inherits the seam; the empty default
``_SUPPORTED_CONDITION_SOURCES`` means "does not consume conditioning" (the
Tier-1 audit guard rejects an enabled ``model.conditioning`` whose sources are
not covered, per CLAUDE.md #9 — no silent no-op).
