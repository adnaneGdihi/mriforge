"""Method C: Teacher-Student Latent Distillation Strategy.

The Teacher (Method A: CrossAttentionOracleUNet) uses markers to extract
a perfect degradation token Z_teacher. The blind Student model learns to
predict the same latent from anatomy alone — no markers needed at test time.

Loss:
    L_total = L_recon(student_pred, clean)
            + λ_distill · ||Z_student - Z_teacher.detach()||²
            + λ_marker · L_marker(student_pred, ideal_marker)

All simulator parameters come from ``config.physics.digital_twin`` (SSOT).
