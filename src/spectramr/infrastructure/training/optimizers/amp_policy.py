        This used to be a **second AMP resolver** and it disagreed with the live
        one on two counts (#806):

        1. It read ``optimization.precision.enabled`` and never
           ``precision.dtype``, so it could not see the third state
           ``PrecisionConfigSchema`` documents -- ``dtype: 'float32'`` disables
           AMP even when ``enabled`` is true. ``resolve_amp_precision(True,
           "float32")`` returns ``(False, 'fp16')``; this returned ``True``.
        2. It force-disabled AMP for any ``model_type`` whose *string* contained
           "diffusion" -- a hardcoded paradigm branch (pitfall #5) silently
           overriding an explicit ``precision.enabled: true``. An arm that needs
           fp32 declares ``precision.dtype: float32``, where the choice is
           validated and stamped into provenance instead of inferred from a
           model-name substring.

        ``resolve_amp_precision`` is what ``BaseTrainingStrategy`` and
        ``build_deepspeed_config`` already use, so there is now one answer to
        "is AMP on?" (pitfall #13b).

        The old ``import torch.amp`` availability probe is gone with them: this
        module imports ``torch`` at load time and ``torch.amp`` has shipped in
        every version this repo supports, so the branch could not be taken.
