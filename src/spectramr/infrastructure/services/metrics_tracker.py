    survives into a sidecar. Without the record a saved PNG is uninterpretable
    after the fact: ``[0, 255]`` says nothing about the physical intensities it
    came from, and the run that motivated this carried
    ``logging.sinks.level: warning``, which would have discarded an INFO

    reports its constant value here). Such a record must never be borrowed as a
    reference; :meth:`MetricsTracker._normalize_images_windowed` gates on this
    flag.

        Foreground-aware per-sample percentile windowing. The earlier
        whole-image [0.5%, 99.5%] approach was correct for normal
        targets but at training-step 0 a kspace cold-diffusion model
        often produces an output whose IFFT magnitude is dominated by a
        small DC-peak blob plus a vast noisy background. The 99.5%
        percentile then sits in the *background-noise* tail, the DC
        blob saturates white, and the rest of the brain is squeezed
        into a narrow band — the May 2026 "bright spot + halo" symptom.

        Fix: compute the upper percentile over **foreground pixels
        only** (above the median + a small slack). When >5% of the
        image is foreground we use the foreground percentile; otherwise
        we fall back to the whole-image percentile so cases where the
        model genuinely outputs near-empty tensors don't divide by
        zero.

        **Degenerate samples are reported, never silently blacked out.**
        This routine used to collapse four *distinct* upstream failures onto
        one byte-identical solid-black PNG, which is a facade (pitfall #16):
        the artifact looks like a render, so nothing downstream registers a
        failure, and the diagnosis is destroyed at exactly the point it was
        available. The four were

        * a single non-finite pixel — ``torch.quantile`` propagates NaN, so
          ``vmin``/``vmax`` went NaN, every pixel normalised to NaN, and
          ``(NaN * 255).astype(np.uint8)`` is undefined behaviour that lands
          on 0. One bad pixel blacked out an otherwise perfect image;
        * an all-non-finite sample (a diverged sampler);
        * a genuinely constant sample (a collapsed model);
        * a *healthy* sample whose dynamic range fell below the absolute
          ``1e-8`` floor — see :attr:`_DEGENERATE_RANGE_RTOL`.

        Two of those are now rendered correctly rather than reported: the
        window is computed over **finite pixels only**, so a sample with a
        few NaNs renders its real content (the non-finite pixels alone go to
        0), and the degeneracy test is relative, so small-magnitude data
        renders identically to the same data scaled up. The remaining two
        are true degeneracies; they still render black, but emit one
        aggregated ``WARNING`` naming the affected sample indices and their
        raw statistics.

        WARNING level is deliberate and load-bearing: ``LoggingService.setup``
        clamps every logger and handler to ``logging.sinks.level``, and the
        arms that hit this path run at ``warning``. An INFO diagnostic here
        would be discarded before it reached the log.

        **A shared window is what makes a pair comparable.** Windowed by its own
        percentiles, every render is a flattering render: the affine map is
        re-fitted to whatever the tensor happens to contain, so a prediction 4x
        too bright, or too dim, or with the wrong contrast, comes out looking
        correct. The transfer function absorbs precisely the error the figure
        exists to display -- pitfall #16, an artifact that looks like evidence.
        Passing ``reference_windows`` renders this tensor under the counterpart's
        window instead, so intensity error survives into the PNG.

        **Sharing opens one new failure mode, and it is reported.** A healthy,
        non-constant sample lying entirely below the borrowed window clamps to
        bit-exact black; entirely above, to solid white. Neither is constant nor
        non-finite, so the degeneracy tests above cannot see it -- exactly the
        silent black-PNG facade that finite-only windowing closed. Full clamping
        against a borrowed window is therefore detected and folded into the same
        aggregated warning.

        The sample's own window is still computed even when a reference is in
        play, because the own window is the *diagnosis*: a collapsed producer
        borrowed into a healthy window renders as a flat tone -- a picture, with
        nothing visibly wrong -- and dropping that test to save three reductions
        would delete the finding.

        Args:
            images: Tensor of images [B, C, H, W]
            context: Optional caller tag (e.g. ``"fake/validation_R32x"``)
                folded into the diagnostic so the warning names *which*
                tensor degenerated rather than just "a batch".
            reference_windows: Per-sample windows from the counterpart render
                (index-aligned), or ``None`` to window each sample by its own
                percentiles. An entry that cannot be lent -- the counterpart was
                blacked out -- falls back to this sample's own window and says
                so in the warning, because the resulting pair is *not* a
                comparison. Indices past the end of the list have no counterpart
                at all and render under their own window silently: the caller's
                ``zip(..., strict=False)`` never writes them.
