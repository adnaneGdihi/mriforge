"""Dotted-path config-override utilities (config-layer SSOT).

``apply_overrides`` and ``_parse_value`` used to live in ``spectramr.main`` (the
CLI/entry layer). ``pipelines/distributed.py`` imported ``apply_overrides`` from
there, which is a **leftward** import (``pipelines/ → main``) that violates the
inward-only dependency rule (CLAUDE.md #13). They are pure config transforms —
turn ``key.subkey=value`` strings into a re-validated :class:`TrainingSettings` —
so their canonical home is the innermost ``config/`` layer, which every layer may
import rightward. ``spectramr.main`` re-exports both for backward compatibility.

def apply_overrides(settings: Any, overrides: list[str]) -> Any:
    """Apply type-safe dot-notation overrides to ``settings``.

    **Type Safety**: values are parsed with :func:`_parse_value` and the whole
    result is re-validated against the Pydantic schema.

    Args:
        settings: ``TrainingSettings`` object.
        overrides: List of ``'key.subkey=value'`` strings, e.g.
            ``'optimization.optimizer.learning_rate=1e-4'``.

    Returns:
        Updated ``TrainingSettings`` object (re-validated).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an override is malformed, traverses an existing non-dict
            node, or the reconstructed config fails schema validation.

    **Why the dump excludes unset fields.** The rebuild below re-validates a
    plain dict, and Pydantic marks every key it receives as *author-set*. A
    COMPLETE ``model_dump()`` therefore hands validation ~2000 defaulted keys
    dressed up as declarations, which breaks every consumer that reads
    ``model_fields_set`` to tell "the author asked for this" from "nobody said,
    so the schema default applies":

    * ``models/losses/weights.py`` — its conflict check documents "a schema
      default is not a declaration". The poisoned set made two *defaulted*
      aliased lambdas (``lambda_perceptual`` = 10.0, ``lambda_content`` = 0.0,
      both canonicalising to ``perceptual``) look like conflicting declarations
      and raise at build time. Net effect: ``audit`` passed and
      ``train --override ...`` died, which is how three ldm_two_stage_ulf_to_hf
      arms failed on 2026-07-25 (SLURM 7796517) — the smoke dispatcher always
      injects ``--override training.max_iterations=<cap>``.
    * ``parallel.deepspeed.compile`` / ``.zenflow`` — their
      ``_knobs_require_enabled`` validators reject knobs declared under a
      disabled block. Against the complete dump they fire on knobs nobody
      wrote, so NO DeepSpeed arm could be overridden at all (issue #1113;
      measured 7 / 120 sampled ``inprogress`` arms, all DeepSpeed).
    * The 2026-05-29 ``model_domain`` round-trip break, worked around at the
      time by forcing that one field's default to ``None``.

    Dumping ``exclude_unset=True`` keeps authorship correct *by construction* —
    the rebuilt set is exactly the authored keys plus the ones this call wrote
    (writing ``a.b.c=1`` puts ``a`` in the root's set, ``b`` in ``a``'s, ``c``
    in ``a.b``'s). It replaces a ~50-line post-hoc repair pass that could not
    help anyway, because the failures above happen *during* the rebuild.

    This does NOT weaken provenance (pitfall #15c). Provenance is stamped from
    the settings OBJECT by
    :meth:`~spectramr.config.settings.TrainingSettings.get_validated_snapshot`,
    which dumps all resolved fields including defaults; it never sees this
    intermediate dict. Nor does it weaken the validators: an override that
    genuinely *introduces* a dead knob (``parallel.deepspeed.zenflow.topk_ratio``
    under ``enabled: false``) still writes that key, so it is still authored and
    still raises.
