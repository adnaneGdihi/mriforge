"""Raw YAML I/O helpers for code paths that must mutate config dicts.

The repo's SSOT for training configuration is
:class:`spectramr.config.settings.TrainingSettings` (frozen Pydantic v2). For
training and inference, code must consume the already-parsed
``TrainingSettings`` — never re-parse the YAML downstream
(`TODO/backlog_ssot_and_layering_cleanup.md` Phase 1).

But there's a small class of build-time tools that legitimately need
the *raw, mutable* dict — they generate new YAMLs from a template,
not consume one for training. Examples:

- :mod:`spectramr.infrastructure.orchestration.ablation_config_generator` —
  reads a base YAML, applies axis overrides, dumps N new YAMLs.
- HPO sub-process spawners — each subprocess legitimately loads its
  own YAML (parallel entry points).

Those tools route through :func:`read_yaml_dict` here rather than
calling ``yaml.safe_load`` directly. Keeping the helper inside
``src/config/`` means the ``tests/unit/test_no_yaml_reparse.py``
guard still passes (config/ is the allowed subtree for raw YAML I/O).
