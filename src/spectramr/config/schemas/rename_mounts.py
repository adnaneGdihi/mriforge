r"""Audit that every :mod:`renames` record is served by a mounted validator.

:data:`~spectramr.config.schemas.renames.RENAMES` is the SSOT for retired config
spellings, but a record only does anything if some schema class mounts the
validator that serves it. Nothing connected the two halves, and the gap is
**silent in both directions**:

* A block owning records with **no mount** loses the record's guided message.
  ``reporting`` was in this state from 2026-08-05 until this module landed: its
  one record named the replacement, the reason, the issue (#503) and the
  one-line fixer, and a user declaring ``per_case_metrics`` saw pydantic's
  generic ``Extra inputs are not permitted`` instead. Where the block is
  ``extra="ignore"`` rather than ``extra="forbid"`` the same gap is worse — the
  key is dropped without a word (pitfall #15).
* A **mount owning no records** is a permanent no-op. Both builders return
  early on an empty table (``if not retired`` / ``if not foldable``), so a
  mount whose block argument is misspelled is indistinguishable from a correct
  one until the day a record is added and does not fire.

:meth:`RenameRecord.__post_init__` already refuses a record whose ``mount``
does not own its keys. This is the same rule from the other side: a mount that
owns no records, and a record that no mount owns, both become findings.

Runtime introspection, not source text. The mounts are read out of pydantic's
own ``__pydantic_decorators__`` registry, so the audit sees exactly what
pydantic sees — a mount added under a different attribute name, or inherited
from a base class (``training/base.py`` mounts one that seven diffusion
``*Params`` subclasses inherit), is still counted. A ``grep`` for the call site
sees 16 mounts where the model tree has 23 class-level appearances, and neither
number is the one that matters: the audit keys on ``(block, posture)``.

Why the ``raise`` half is a promotion precondition
--------------------------------------------------

57 of ~163 mounted schema classes are ``extra="ignore"``, and :mod:`renames`
opens with what that costs: "simply deleting a field is *worse* than leaving
the ambiguity in place -- the key stops working **and** stops being visible."
Promoting a drained ``fold`` record to ``raise`` in a block that cannot refuse
it converts a working fold into exactly that silent drop. When the first 31
records were promoted, **28** landed in blocks (``data``, ``logging``,
``losses``, ``validation``) mounting ``fold_renamed_keys`` and no
``reject_renamed_keys``: the retired key was accepted and discarded, and
``exclude_defaults`` came back ``[]`` from a config that declared ``["mse"]``.
So a record may only be promoted once its block's ``raise`` mount exists, and
this audit is what makes that checkable instead of remembered.
