"""Config-key rename SSOT — one table, consumed by four things.

A key that moves must fail **loudly** at the old spelling. That is not automatic
here: 57 of ~163 mounted schema classes are ``extra="ignore"``, including
``data:``, ``model:``, ``physics:``, ``losses:``, ``logging:`` and
``acceleration:``. Inside those, simply deleting a field is *worse* than leaving
the ambiguity in place — the key stops working **and** stops being visible, so a
config keeps loading while silently training something else.

So every rename is declared here once and consumed by:

1. :func:`reject_renamed_keys` — a ``mode="before"`` validator mixed into the
   owning block, which raises naming the replacement.
2. ``scripts/ci/migrate_config_keys.py`` — rewrites YAML from the same table, so
   the fixer and the check can never disagree about what the rename *is*.
3. ``scripts/ci/check_no_legacy_config_keys.py`` — the corpus gate that drives
   each entry's usage to zero, after which the entry (and the shim) is deleted.
4. :func:`canonical_override_path`, used by ``config/overrides.py`` so a
   ``--override`` written in the old spelling lands on the new key. A staged
   rename that the CLI does not know about turns every legacy ``--override``
   into a hard error; see that function for why.

Two record kinds, because they are not mechanically interchangeable
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A **move** (``optimization.accumulate_grad_steps`` ->
``optimization.gradient_accumulation_steps``) is a pure key rewrite: the value
carries over untouched.

A **sense inversion** — a boolean whose meaning flips, so that
``disable_x: true`` and ``enable_x: true`` are opposite behaviours — is *not*: a
migrator that rewrote the key alone would silently invert every affected arm.
Those carry ``value_transform="negate"`` so the migrator negates the literal and
the error message tells a human to do the same.

**No production record uses it.** The example this docstring used to give,
``losses.disable_default_losses``, is a ``list[str]`` of loss NAMES rather than a
boolean — negating it is meaningless, and it was retired in phase 10d as
``losses.policy.exclude_defaults`` with ``identity``. It was also the repo's only
claimed negated boolean, so the naming rule's "negation is forbidden" clause
currently has no violations to drain. Keep the machinery: it is cheap, tested
against a fixture table, and the first genuine ``enable_``/``disable_`` pair will
need it.

Two postures, because some renames are too big to land atomically
------------------------------------------------------------------

A ``raise`` record (the default) means the legacy spelling is **gone**. Land it
in the same PR as the corpus migration that drives its usage to zero — otherwise
the next load of an unmigrated arm is a hard failure with no fixer run yet.

That rule is only affordable while the affected corpus is small. It is not
affordable for a key like ``optimization.learning_rate``, which **826 loadable
arms declare**: retiring it atomically means one PR that rewrites the entire
corpus, and no reviewer can check that diff against a schema change buried in
the same commit.

A ``fold`` record is the staged form. The ``mode="before"`` validator *moves* the
value to its canonical path instead of raising, so unmigrated YAML keeps loading
while the code above it reads one path only. Critically this is **not** the
forwarding property the design forbids: nothing is added to the model, so
``config.optimization.learning_rate`` raises ``AttributeError`` the moment the
field moves. There is one read path in Python and, temporarily, two accepted
spellings in YAML.

The promotion rule, which is what stops "staged" from meaning "permanent":

1. ``scripts/ci/check_no_legacy_config_keys.py`` counts fold hits every run and
   prints the remaining total. Fold hits do **not** fail the gate; raise hits do.
2. When a fold record's count reaches zero, flip ``posture`` to ``raise``.
3. When every record for a block is ``raise``, delete the fold validator from it.

A fold record's canonical path must stay **inside its own block** — the
validator is mounted on that block and cannot reach a sibling. Pinned by
``tests/unit/config/test_renames.py``.

#: Fold records whose corpus declaration count has reached **zero**, and which
#: are therefore retired outright: :func:`_folds` gives these ``posture="raise"``
#: instead of ``"fold"``.
#:
#: This is the promotion rule in the module docstring, applied. Keeping the
#: promoted names in one set rather than lifting 31 pairs out of their
#: ``_folds`` calls means the ratchet's progress is legible in a single place,
#: and a record stays next to the siblings that share its rationale.
#:
#: **Never hand-edit this.** Regenerate it from the gate, which derives the
#: count from the fixer itself::
#:
#:     python scripts/ci/check_no_legacy_config_keys.py
#:
#: and copy the records it lists as DRAINED and promotable (0 staged, 0
#: unreachable). Promoting a record the corpus still declares hard-fails those
#: arms at load -- which is the whole reason the count gates the flip.
#:
#: Measured 2026-08-09 on `dev` after PR #906 drained `experiments/inprogress/`:
#: 41 of 161 fold records drained; 120 still declared.
#:
#: Re-measured 2026-08-18 on `dev` @ 30d216a74, immediately before the promotion
#: below: 118 fold records, 17 drained, 101 still declared. **Run the gate over
#: BOTH root sets before promoting** -- the default roots are `experiments/` plus
#: the two reference templates, and a record drained there can still be declared
#: under `tests/`, `src/spectramr/config/presets/` or `scripts/`, which the default
#: invocation never opens::
#:
#:     python scripts/ci/check_no_legacy_config_keys.py
#:     python scripts/ci/check_no_legacy_config_keys.py tests src/spectramr/config/presets scripts
#:
#: (roots are POSITIONAL; `--roots` exits 2 on argparse, which reads as a gate
#: failure in a repo whose convention is that warnings exit 2.) Those 17 were
#: drained in both -- 17 of 118 in the first, inside the 84 of 118 in the second.
#:
#: A leaf grep is not a third opinion, it is a WORSE instrument, and it fails in
#: both directions. Resolving each raw-YAML hit's PARENT BLOCK for those 17 found
#: one over-count (`svd_calibration_lines` at `config_version: '1.0'` -- but under
#: `data.coils:`, i.e. already canonical, because that rename preserves the leaf)
#: and one key that is not this record at all (`val_batch_size` under `data:`,
#: where `extra="ignore"` silently drops it -- filed as #1205). Neither is a
#: declaration of the record being promoted.
#:
#: The gate's countdown is necessary but NOT sufficient for a flip. It scans
#: `experiments/` plus the two reference templates and counts YAML declarations.
#: The population it cannot see is **Python**: a dict literal or constructor kwarg
#: in a test reaches the schema with no corpus and no version gate in front of it,
#: so it breaks the moment the record raises. Of the 30 records sitting at 0 on
#: 2026-08-09, **23 were declared in Python**; 7 were free outright and 3 more
#: were promoted here after repointing the 8 tests that declared them. The
#: remaining 20 need their declarations migrated first.
#:
#: **`data.output_domain` was listed here as "216 sites" and it was promoted on
#: 2026-08-13 with zero migration.** That number did not survive re-measurement:
#: an AST walk for the three declaration shapes below found **0**, and running
#: the 60 `tests/unit` files that mention the leaf produced a failure set
#: IDENTICAL to `dev` (11 failed / 2172 passed vs 11 failed / 2173 passed -- the
#: extra pass is this record's own new case). 216 was almost certainly a
#: leaf-name count: `output_domain` is spelled by three unrelated owners --
#: `losses.output_domain` (a separate fold record, 101 live corpus
#: declarations), the `@register_model` `output_domain` capability (51 files
#: under `models/generators/`), and this record. A grep for the leaf returns
#: 2926 hits corpus-wide and **every one of them belongs to one of the other
#: two**. Re-measure a per-record count through the loader before believing it.
#:
#: A static scan of that population is a LOWER bound, never an upper one. An AST
#: walk found 20; running the tests found 3 more (`data.loso_fold`,
#: `data.max_train_subjects`, `validation.input_dependence_tol`), declared as
#: bare kwargs to the BLOCK schema -- `DataConfigSchema(loso_fold=3)` -- where
#: there is no enclosing `data:` key to reconstruct a path from. Promote, run the
#: tests, and diff against the same selection on `dev`; the scan only tells you
#: where to look.
#:
#: Promotion also turns a legacy kwarg into a `ValidationError`, so any
#: `pytest.raises(ValidationError)` over that kwarg goes VACUOUS rather than red
#: -- it starts catching the rename instead of the constraint it was written for.
#: Repoint those to the canonical spelling in the same change; they will not
#: appear in the failure diff.
#:
#: A third population WRITES config keys rather than declaring them: `src/` code
#: seeding a preset or deriving a value through `default_knob` / `override_knob`
#: (`loader._sync_coil_processing_to_legacy`, and `DataConfigSchema`'s M4Raw
#: block). Neither instrument above can see it -- the YAML gate reads no Python,
#: and an AST walk looking for declaration shapes sees only a string argument.
#: Until 2026-08-18 this was not a risk but a GUARANTEED break: `_canonical_tail`
#: consulted posture, so every such writer silently reverted to the flat spelling
#: the moment its record was promoted, and the arm then failed to load on a key
#: its author never wrote. `data.svd_calibration_lines` below is the record that
#: surfaced it, and `_canonical_tail`'s docstring carries the post-mortem. The
#: helpers no longer consult posture, so this population is now safe by
#: construction; what still needs checking before a promotion is any caller that
#: hard-codes a legacy spelling WITHOUT going through them.
#:
#: Test YAML fixtures are NOT that population, contrary to the obvious guess:
#: all 65 tracked YAMLs under `tests/` declare `6.0` (42) or `5.0` (23), so none
#: of them reaches the loader and none can break a promotion. That is also why
#: `migrate_config_keys.py` reports "no retired keys found" over `tests/` unless
#: you pass `--all-versions` -- it skips every one of them.
#:
#: So: measure the Python population before adding a name here. The countdown
#: alone will tell you a record is free when it is not.

    knob LIVES, and for a ``raise`` record that is still ``canonical``.

    This used to read ``rec.posture != "fold"``, which reverted all three to the

    * :func:`default_knob` promises to "seed a preset default at the CANONICAL
      path"; it went back to writing the legacy one. That is verbatim the
      collision its own docstring records being written to fix, except the
      legacy key now *raises* rather than merely disagreeing -- so a preset
      would hand the user an unloadable arm naming a key the user never wrote.
    * :func:`override_knob` calls clearing the legacy spelling "the load-bearing
      half"; it popped the legacy key and then wrote it straight back.
    * :func:`declared_knob` stopped being able to SEE a canonical declaration,
      returning ``UNDECLARED`` for a value sitting right there -- a silent wrong
      answer, and the one of the three with no fail-loud story at all.

    knob-helper leaf -- ``coil_processing_mode``, ``num_virtual_coils``,
    ``normalize_kspace``, ``kspace_percentile`` -- would have hit the same wall.

    A user's own retired declaration is unaffected: :func:`reject_renamed_keys`
    reads the raw block directly, and :func:`declared_knob` checks the legacy key
    *before* consulting this function, so the rejection still fires.

    The guard that remains is a same-block one. ``training.seed -> run.seed``
    moves to a different top-level block, so its tail is not this block's to
    write; such records keep the flat leaf and let the rejection validator speak.

    **disagree**, the arm records two intentions and only a human can say which
    it meant. Agreeing duplicates drop the legacy key silently.

    Mounted at :data:`ROOT` it renames a whole top-level BLOCK: the value it
    moves is the block's entire mapping, and the destination is the full
    canonical path rather than a path relative to a block. That is the only
    place a fold may cross blocks — a per-block validator is mounted on one
    class and cannot reach a sibling, but the root one is mounted on
    ``TrainingSettings`` and can reach every top-level block. Pydantic runs the
    root ``mode="before"`` validator before any sub-model is constructed, so the
    renamed block is built from the destination field, never the retired one.

    A legacy leaf may **not** share its name with a destination sub-block. The
    fold matches on the key alone, so if ``validation.metrics: [psnr]`` folded
    into ``validation.metrics.compute``, the key ``metrics`` would mean both the
    retired scalar and the block four siblings fold into — and the two are
    indistinguishable. Legacy-only arms would break on declaration order (a
    sibling declared above ``metrics`` descends into a *list*), and a MIGRATED
    arm writing ``metrics: {compute: [...]}`` would have that whole block folded
    into itself. Pinned by
    ``test_renames.py::TestNoLegacyLeafNamesADestinationBlock``, which is why
    the phase-10 block is ``scoring`` rather than ``metrics``.
