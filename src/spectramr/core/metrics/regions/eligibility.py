"""The ROI eligibility gate: which metrics may be scored on which regions.

A fastMRI+ pathology bbox is ~40x40 px. On an ROI that small, roughly half the
metric pool is **ill-defined**:

* **MS-SSIM** needs >= 161 px/side for its 5 dyadic scales.
* **NIQE / BRISQUE** fit natural-scene statistics on patches.
* **LPIPS / DISTS / FID / KID** compute deep-network statistics; on 40 px of
  content those statistics are meaningless.
* **Spectral metrics** -- an image-space crop's FFT is a convolution with a sinc,
  **not** a restriction of k-space. The crop does not compute "the spectrum of the
  ROI"; it computes a smeared spectrum of the whole slice.
* **Physics NR metrics** (``g_factor``, ``ndcr``, ``prp_snr``, …) consume the
  *measurement* (k-space, coil maps, sampling mask). Restricting them to an image
  ROI is a category error, not an approximation.

Without a gate, every one of those still returns a *number*, and the per-segment
leaderboard becomes noise dressed as science. So: the gate returns NaN **and a
machine-readable reason**, and the metric object is **never invoked**.

Three tiers
-----------

``MAP_THEN_MASK`` (preferred) -- compute the full-FOV spatial error map, then
average over the mask. Exact for MSE/MAE/PSNR, and it keeps correct neighbourhood
statistics at the ROI boundary for SSIM: the SSIM map at an ROI pixel uses an 11x11
Gaussian neighbourhood that may extend *outside* the ROI, which is correct -- that
is the structure the pixel actually sits in. A crop truncates it, and for a 40x40
ROI the 11-px boundary band is ~65% of the pixels.

``CROP_THEN_COMPUTE`` -- tight bbox crop, no resampling, no padding, no zeroing of
out-of-region pixels inside the bbox (zeroing manufactures a hard edge that LPIPS
and NIQE will happily "detect"). Required for metrics with no spatial map. Because
the bbox of a non-rectangular region (GM, WM) is a strict superset of the region,
crop-tier metrics are **ineligible on non-rectangular regions** -- cropping would
score the bbox, not the tissue.

``NOT_RESTRICTABLE`` -- NaN + reason. The metric is never called.

No safe default
---------------

There is deliberately **no fallback tier**. Defaulting to ``CROP`` would silently
run new metrics on 40 px crops; defaulting to ``NOT_RESTRICTABLE`` would make them
silently vanish from every regional leaderboard. Both are fabrications. An
undeclared metric therefore raises :class:`KeyError` -- loud, and fixable in one
line.

The normalisation trap
----------------------

PSNR's peak, SSIM's ``data_range``, NMSE's denominator. If ``data_range`` is
recomputed *from the ROI*, then "SSIM on GM" and "SSIM on the bbox" use different
C1/C2 and are **not comparable across regions** -- the metric has silently changed
per region. The rule: **error terms are masked; normalisation constants are
computed once on the full slice.** Every policy states which it does, and that
string is stamped on every output row.

      it to 161x161, and the metric returned a confident score computed on interpolated
      detail. That is the exact fabrication this package exists to decline, running inside
      the thing built to prevent it.
    * the 27 context metrics (``ndcr``, ``are``, ``csoe``, ``prp_snr``, …) register late,
      so they were **absent** from the table and ``policy_for`` raised ``KeyError``
      mid-sweep rather than declining them.
