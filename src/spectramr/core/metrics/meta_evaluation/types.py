"""Shared dataclasses for the meta-evaluation framework.

Five rankers (CDSCR, LGDR, SFA, ESD, FSPD) each consume a ``MetricSet`` and
a ``MetricEvaluationDataset`` and emit a ``RankingResult``. Keeping all three
contracts here avoids circular imports between ranker modules.

The container types here are intentionally light. They are *not* Pydantic
models — meta-evaluation runs as an offline analysis after training, not
inside the frozen ``TrainingSettings`` graph, and Pydantic's validation cost
on per-sample tensors would dominate.
