        ``real_metric_values`` is a held-out *real* cohort's per-metric scalar values
        (same metric names as the simulated run). The simulated/real law TV is the
        **max** of two lower bounds on the joint-law TV the transfer theorem needs:
        (a) the per-metric *marginal* score-law TV (:func:`transfer.tv_distance_samples`,
        max over metrics), and (b) the *joint*-law TV
        (:func:`transfer.tv_distance_joint_samples`, a 1-NN classifier two-sample test
        on the multivariate metric vectors). The joint estimate is a tighter lower
        bound — it catches a sim→real shift that hides in the dependence structure even
        when every marginal matches — so the certificate is less optimistic. The
        per-pair ``TV < Δ/8`` certificate (Lean ``ranking_transfer``) is issued against
        the aggregate simulated scores. A pair that ``transfers`` keeps its simulated
        ordering under the real law.
