"""Per-voxel prediction intervals calibrated on a known fiducial.

A super-resolution network emits a point estimate. Deciding whether a structure
in that estimate is trustworthy needs an interval, and an interval is only worth
having if it comes with a coverage guarantee. Split conformal prediction
supplies one — distribution-free, finite-sample — but it needs a calibration set
whose residuals are **exchangeable** with the test residuals, and on real data
that means held-out ground truth, which is exactly what ULF-to-HF translation
does not have at inference time.

The fiducial supplies one. Its true value is known everywhere, so residuals on
marker support are computable **without any ground truth on the anatomy**.

That is not free. Marker residuals are exchangeable with anatomy residuals only
if the two populations are comparable, and a Gaussian probe is not a brain.
Conditioning on a difficulty score makes the assumption narrower and, crucially,
**testable**: stratify by difficulty, calibrate within each stratum, then measure
per-stratum coverage on paired validation where ground truth does exist. If a
stratum's empirical coverage misses its nominal level, exchangeability has
failed there and the interval carries no guarantee — a reportable outcome, not
something to patch around by loosening the stratification.

This is a different construction from
:mod:`spectramr.core.metrics.meta_evaluation.conformal`, which is conformal RISK
control for selecting metrics. Nothing is shared beyond the name.

    which is the only kind this cohort has.
