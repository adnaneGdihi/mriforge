    its ``forward`` still takes ``target`` as a required positional, ignoring it.
    Dispatching on the declaration alone (the shape a naive reading of the
    registry suggests) hands those 69 one argument too few and converts a working
    measurement into a swallowed ``TypeError`` -> NaN. So we dispatch on the
    signature and use the declaration only as a *cross-check*.
