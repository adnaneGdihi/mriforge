"""Tissue-segmentation agreement metrics for image synthesis / translation.

The ULF->HF cohort ships **no segmentation labels and no brain masks** (verified
against ``scripts/preprocessing/preprocess_ulf_paired.py``'s record schema, the
manifest key set, and ``UniversalMRIDataset``). So these metrics do not grade a
prediction against a reference *segmentation*; they segment the **prediction and
the target with the same deterministic segmenter** and measure whether the two
label maps agree. That is the standard downstream-task-consistency eval for
synthesis (the SynthSeg-Dice protocol used by SynthSR / LF-SynthSR), and it asks
the question PSNR cannot: *does the synthesized high-field image still support the
same tissue partition as the real one?*

Why not reuse ``synthseg_dice``'s :class:`LabelDiceBackend`? That proxy bins by
intensity **quantile**, so its classes are equal-population *by construction*: it
sees spatial arrangement only, is invariant to any monotone intensity change, and
its per-class volumes can never disagree. :class:`OtsuTissueSegmenter` derives its
thresholds from the histogram instead, so class sizes are data-driven and both
blur and volume error actually register. The two are complementary — run both.

Properties worth knowing before you cite these numbers:

* **Independent thresholds.** Prediction and target are each segmented with their
  *own* Otsu thresholds. The Dice is therefore invariant to a global *affine*
  intensity change (brightness/contrast), by design — it isolates structure, which
  PSNR/MAE already fail to isolate. Non-linear contrast errors and blur do move the
  thresholds and are penalised.
* **Slice-Dice, not volume-Dice.** Under ``data.slice_2d: true`` the validation loop
  hands these metrics one axial slice at a time, so the reported value is a mean of
  per-slice Dice, not a volumetric Dice. Small slices carry equal weight to large
  ones. Aggregate over a *representative* slice set (do not leave
  ``validation.num_validation_batches`` at a small N — the val loader is unshuffled,
  so a small N means "the first N adjacent slices of one volume").
* **"Tissue" is a proxy, and on ADC it is not tissue at all.** The 3-class partition
  approximates CSF/GM/WM on T1w/T2w/FLAIR. On an ADC map it is a generic intensity
  partition — still a valid agreement readout, but do not call those classes tissue.
  The names are deliberately neutral (``tissue_*``, never ``gm_*``/``wm_*``).

Never returns NaN: ``pipelines/train.py`` accumulates validation metrics with a bare
running sum and no non-finite guard, so a single NaN would poison the metric for the
whole evaluation.
