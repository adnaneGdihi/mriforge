"""Super-Nyquist fidelity: per-band transfer gain above the acquisition Nyquist.

PSNR and SSIM are dominated by the low frequencies every method already gets
right. Neither can tell whether the detail a super-resolution network adds was
*unfolded* from inter-frame aliasing or *invented* from a prior, because both
produce a sharp, plausible image.

This metric splits the comparison at the acquisition Nyquist (see
:mod:`spectramr.infrastructure.physics.band_partition`) and reports the transfer
gain

.. math::

    \\rho_\\ell = \\frac{\\langle P_\\ell, T_\\ell\\rangle}
                       {\\|P_\\ell\\|\\,\\|T_\\ell\\|}

per band, where :math:`P_\\ell, T_\\ell` are the band-``l`` components of the
prediction and the reference. Bands with ``rho > 1`` were never measured.

**What the number means depends entirely on what it is computed over, and the
two readings must not be conflated (pitfall #18).**

On the *anatomy* pair it is a descriptive statistic: a high super-Nyquist
:math:`\\rho_\\ell` on held-out anatomy could still come from a prior that
happens to match the population, since the reference was used to fit the
network's peers.

On a *known exogenous instrument* — the virtual fiducial, whose high-frequency
structure is fixed, anatomy-independent, and known exactly at every frequency —
it is a certificate. The instrument passes through the same decimation as the
anatomy, so :math:`\\rho_\\ell` above Nyquist measures how much unmeasured
detail the network genuinely recovers rather than fabricates. That is the use
:class:`~spectramr.infrastructure.training.strategies.multi_acquisition_strategy.ConcreteMultiAcquisitionStrategy`
puts it to.
