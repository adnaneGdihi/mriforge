"""§8.3 Tier 3 — channelized-Hotelling-observer (CHO) task concordance.

A good no-reference (NR) metric should track *task performance*: as a
signal-detection task gets harder (more noise, more blur, more motion), both
human readers and a model observer detect the target less reliably. This tier
builds a **signal-known-exactly** lesion-detection task, sweeps degradation
severity, measures task detectability :math:`d'` with a channelized Hotelling
observer (CHO), and checks that each NR metric's trajectory is concordant with
the :math:`d'` trajectory along the severity axis.

Method (signal-known-exactly CHO, Barrett & Myers)
--------------------------------------------------
For each clean reference and each degradation family:

1. Insert a small 2-D Gaussian blob lesion at the image centre to form the
   ``present`` reference; the ``absent`` reference is the clean image
   (see :func:`_insert_blob`).
2. Build a fixed Gabor channel bank for the image shape
   (:func:`~spectramr.infrastructure.physics.model_observer.gabor_channel_bank`).
3. For each severity ``theta`` on ``linspace(low, 1.0, n_severities)``: draw
   ``n_ensemble`` degraded present realisations and ``n_ensemble`` degraded
   absent realisations (each with a distinct seeded generator), flatten each to
   a pixel column, and compute
   :math:`d' = \\sqrt{\\max(0, d'^2)}` via
   :meth:`ChannelizedHotellingObserver.detectability`.
4. Evaluate each NR metric on the *mean* degraded present image versus the
   present reference (one NR value per severity) via :func:`cards.eval_metric`.

Per metric and family we take ``|Spearman rho_S|`` between the NR trajectory and
the :math:`d'` trajectory over the severity axis (direction-agnostic: a metric
that rises *or* falls with detectability is concordant). The headline score is
the mean ``|rho_S|`` across non-degenerate families; it passes when that mean
clears ``rho_threshold``.

This module is part of the offline, research-mode NR validation harness — the NR
metrics are validation-pending and never run during training. Everything is
CPU-canonical and deterministic (every RNG is an explicitly-seeded
``torch.Generator``); no scorer ever raises (failures are recorded as NaN).
