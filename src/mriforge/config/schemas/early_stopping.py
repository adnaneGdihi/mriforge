        """Refuse a ``mode`` that contradicts the metric's own direction.

        ``mode: max`` on a loss stops the run when the loss stops RISING, and
        writes ``checkpoint_best.pt`` at the WORST iterate. Nothing downstream
        notices: the comparison is well-defined, the counter advances, the file
        is written, and every artifact reports success. The selected model is
        simply the wrong one -- pitfall #16, decided by a single enum.

        The direction is not guessed. ``metric_higher_is_better`` is the single
        resolver already shared by the metrics tracker, ``keep_best_n``, early
        stopping itself and the campaign ranker, and it RAISES rather than
        guessing on an unresolvable key. An unknown metric is therefore left
        alone here: naming a metric this schema cannot resolve is a different
        defect with a different owner (the monitor resolution at first
        validation, #178), and duplicating that rejection here would report one
        problem as two.

        A DISABLED block is left alone, matching the sibling check in
        ``infrastructure/services/early_stopping.py``, which has always opened
        with ``if not self.enabled ... return``. Its ``mode`` selects nothing --
        no monitor runs and no checkpoint is chosen through it -- so there is no
        wrong answer for it to give. Until this exemption existed the two checks
        disagreed, and because the schema runs first (at config load) the
        service's exemption was unreachable: a disabled block with a
        contradictory ``mode`` was refused by one owner and excused by the other.
        Measured when closing that gap: 165 corpus arms disable early stopping
        and NONE of them contradicts its metric, so this changes no arm's
        loadability today -- it settles which of two rules is the real one.

        Imported inside the method, mirroring ``renames.py``'s use of
        ``core.execution_ledger``: the direction table is a ``core/`` fact and
        importing it at module scope would make every config import pull the
        metric registry in behind it.
