    in step.

    - ``LIVE``: a **registered forward model** (a linear operator OR a signal
      model) AND a regime-tagged strategy AND regime-tagged metrics — runs.
      Together: the physics is expressible, trainable, and gradeable on its own
      terms.
    - ``PARTIAL``: either a regime-tagged strategy, or BOTH tagged losses and tagged
      metrics — runs; the audit reports the gap. (Metrics *alone* is EVAL_ONLY, not
      PARTIAL: the distinction decides whether ``train`` is allowed to run.)
    - ``EVAL_ONLY``: metrics exist, zero losses/strategies — ``evaluate``/``predict`` run, ``train`` raises.
    - ``STUB``: nothing exists — every pipeline raises ``WorkflowNotImplementedError``.

    LIVE deliberately does NOT require tagged **losses**. A regime may honestly
    train on agnostic objectives — ``mri_structural`` trains on L1/SSIM, which is
    correct rather than a gap — and requiring a tag would force mis-tagging L1 as
    structural-only. Metrics are required because the asymmetry is real: a regime
    can train on a generic objective, but it cannot be *graded* generically once
    its output stops being an image (PSNR on a Ktrans map is pitfall #18).

    The forward-model clause accepts either kind because an ``OperatorRegistry``
    entry promises ``adjoint()`` while a signal model is nonlinear and has none.
    Before it was widened it demanded an operator, so ``mri_perfusion`` could only
    reach LIVE by registering a fake adjoint — the rule rewarded the facade it

    Adding a member is a four-line change (enum entry + variant class), which is
    the point of the union — extension should be cheap.

    Kept in agreement with the union's actual tags by
    ``test_the_enum_and_the_union_agree``, so this cannot rot into documentation.
