"""Config for GenerativeRefinerStrategy (MRIxFields2026 saturation work, Track A).

Read by ``GenerativeRefinerStrategy`` via ``config.training.generative_refiner``.

The strategy is the shared *generative-iterative refiner* chassis, generalized from
the b22 ``ulf_dps`` recipe (the only cohort arm that broke the saturation ceiling):
train a field-conditioned diffusion **prior** with a non-saturating eps-matching
objective, and at inference run a DDIM/DPS reverse loop whose per-step data-consistency
guidance is driven by a **pluggable forward operator** ``A`` (the arm's distinctive
mechanism). ``guidance_weight = 0`` recovers the unconditional prior and is the one-knob
ablation, exactly as ``likelihood_weight = 0`` is for b22.

``forward_operator`` is a closed ``Literal`` so an unknown/unimplemented mechanism is
rejected at config-load time (pitfall #9, no silent fallback) rather than degrading to a
default at runtime.
