"""Typed strategy hyperparameter sub-blocks (2026-08 knob-wiring batch).

The unfinished tail of the 2026-06 batch — see
:mod:`mriforge.config.schemas.training.strategy_knobs_2026_06`, whose docstring
states the rule and the cluster incident that produced it. The mechanism is
identical and worth restating, because this batch is where it cost a result:

:class:`~mriforge.config.schemas.training.base.TrainingStrategyConfigSchema` is
``extra="allow"``. A paradigm block the schema never declares is stored as the
plain ``dict`` it arrived as — and every strategy reads its knobs with
``getattr(cfg, "knob", default)``, which on a ``dict`` returns the **default**.
The YAML validates, the key appears in provenance, and the declared value is
discarded. Pitfall #15, and #17 when the discarded value was an ablation's axis.

Measured 2026-08-02 across ``experiments/``: **18 undeclared paradigm blocks
over 20 arms**. The sharpest case is in this module's fMRI pair:

.. code-block:: text

    idea_1_spatial_only_sfc.yaml             declares lambda_t: 0.0
    idea_1_spatiotemporal_adaptive_sfc.yaml  declares lambda_t: 0.01
    ...both resolved to 0.01 -- the ablation and its own baseline were
    runtime-identical, so any measured delta between them was noise.

    idea_2_long_echo_spacing.yaml            declares t_esp: 1.0e-3
    ...resolved to 5.0e-4, and t_esp IS that arm's stated axis.

Declaring the block as a typed model is the whole fix: ``cfg`` stops being a
dict, so the strategies' existing ``getattr`` calls resolve correctly. **No
strategy edit is required.**

Every default below is the value the strategy already falls back to, so an arm
that does not declare the block behaves exactly as it did. Some arms declare
exactly the default — for those the fix is a runtime no-op that restores the
MEANING of the declaration rather than its value.

Landed cohort by cohort: fMRI (4 blocks), MRF (3), novel_2026 (3), spec_tasks (2).

``physics_eq_ssl`` is deliberately EXCLUDED. That strategy already solved the
problem the other way round — it asserts the block IS a dict, reads it with
``pe.get(...)``, and does its own typo rejection
(``physics_equivariant_ssl_strategy.py:138-160``). Mounting a typed block would
make its ``isinstance(pe, dict)`` guard fail and raise ``TypeError`` on the one
arm that uses it. Converting it needs a strategy edit, so it is not part of a
schema-only batch.
