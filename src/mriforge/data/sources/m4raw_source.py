"""M4Raw volume source -- the control cohort for the region axis.

M4Raw is where the region machinery gets validated **first**, before a byte of
fastMRI is downloaded: it is already on the cluster, its NEX pseudo-GT is already
implemented, and its anatomical tiers are the *control condition* for the fastMRI+
pathology tiers anyway. If the leaderboard does not move between ``full`` and
``brain`` on M4Raw, the region axis has a problem that has nothing to do with
lesions.

M4Raw carries no pathology annotations, so it emits ``full`` and (when a SynthSeg
cache exists) the tissue tiers -- never ``path:*`` or ``control:*``.

The reference is the NEX pseudo-GT
----------------------------------
Multi-repetition complex k-space averaging (Macovski 1996) gives the full sqrt(N)
SNR boost, and :func:`~mriforge.infrastructure.physics.m4raw_pseudo_gt.synthesize_pseudo_gt`
is the SSOT for it. This source wraps it rather than re-deriving a reference --
sim2rank grades every metric against this image, so a second, subtly different
reference implementation would silently change what "correct" means.
