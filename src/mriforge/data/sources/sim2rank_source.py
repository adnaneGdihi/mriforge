"""The volume-source seam sim2rank consumes.

Why a Protocol and not ``DataPipelineDirector``
-----------------------------------------------
``.claude/rules/data.md`` says *file -> Dataset code lives under
``src/mriforge/data/``* -- which is exactly where this lives. It does **not** say
"everything goes through the director". The director takes a ``BuilderContext``
carrying a frozen ``TrainingSettings``; sim2rank is an argparse analysis harness
with no training config, so routing it through the director would mean
**fabricating a fake TrainingSettings** -- a facade (pitfall #16) erected in the
name of following a rule that was never about this.

The precedent is already committed:
``mriforge.data.datasets.m4raw_repetition_groups`` says in its own docstring that
this grouping logic belongs under ``src/mriforge/data/`` and *not* in
``scripts/sim2rank``, and both the sweep and the CLI import it from here.

So: a narrow Protocol, in the data layer, that yields slices. ``scripts/sim2rank``
imports it; ``src/`` never imports ``scripts/`` (non-negotiable #5).
