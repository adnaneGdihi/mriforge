"""TorchIO Queue Builder - Phase T2 Refactoring.

Extracts queue creation logic from ConsolidatedDatasetFactory.

Provides reusable, testable builders for constructing TorchIO Queue pipelines
for training and validation, with support for:
- Queue length configuration
- Samples per volume tuning
- Patch-based sampling with uniform distribution
- Validation strategies (queue-based vs direct)
- Worker configuration for parallel data loading

Usage:
    config = TorchIOQueueConfig(
        queue_length=256,
        samples_per_volume=16,
        patch_size=(256, 256),
    )
    val_queue, val_loader = TorchIOQueueBuilder.build_val_queue(
        val_dataset, config, slice_aware=False
    )
