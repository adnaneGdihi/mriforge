"""Epoch-ordering samplers for slice-expanded volumetric datasets.

Canonical home for ``torch.utils.data.Sampler`` implementations that exist to make an
IO pattern affordable, as opposed to the ``torchio`` patch samplers built in
:mod:`mriforge.data.builders.sampler_factory` (which choose WHERE in a volume to sample).
These choose the ORDER in which already-chosen samples are visited.

class VolumeBlockedSliceSampler(Sampler[int]):
    """Visit slice samples in volume-resident blocks, shuffled inside each block.

    **The problem.** Expanding a paired volumetric dataset to one sample per depth slice
    is the right sampling — a central-slice dataset throws away ~363/364 of every volume
    — but it makes the naive epoch order pathological. Under a plain shuffled loader each
    ``(container, slice)`` is visited once per epoch in random order, so a resident-volume
    budget only helps if it can hold the WHOLE working set. For the MRIxFields corpus that
    is ~45 volumes at ~226 MB, so every sample is very likely a fresh full-volume decode.
    Measured: one decode is ~0.51 s, which at 150k iterations is tens of GPU-hours of pure
    data wait per arm — the starvation failure recorded in
    ``docs/mrixfields_gpu_starvation_fix.rst``.

    **The fix** is not a bigger cache, it is a better order. Consume the containers that
    share a resident volume set together, so one decode is amortised over every foreground
    slice of every container that volume participates in. Volume sharing is high because
    the pairing policies are combinatorial: a 5-field ``all_pairs`` group is 20 ordered
    pairs drawn from 5 volumes, so 5 decodes serve ~5,000 samples. Simulated on a
    3-group/5-field/250-slice corpus with a 6-volume budget: a plain shuffle costs ~18,700
    decodes per epoch, this order costs ~78 — a 240x reduction.

    **Why not ``tio.Queue``.** This is precisely ``tio.Queue``'s algorithm — load a few
    volumes, emit many patches from each, shuffle them in a bounded buffer — and that was
    the first thing checked. Two things rule the Queue itself out here:

    1. ``MRIxFieldsPairedDataset`` emits plain dicts, not ``tio.Subject``. The
       ``DataPipelineDirector`` already routes ``mrixfields`` and ``npy_slice`` around the
       Queue for exactly this reason: the queue's patch-compatibility filter calls
       ``subj.get_images_names()`` and crashes on a dict.
    2. More fundamentally, ``tio.Queue`` amortises per *Subject*, and a Subject here would
       have to be a PAIR. A volume shared by N pairs would be decoded once per pair —
       40 volume-loads for a 20-pair group where 5 suffice. The sharing structure this
       sampler exploits is invisible at Subject granularity.

    So the algorithm is reused and the container is not. ``max_resident_volumes`` plays
    ``max_length``'s role (the RAM bound) and the block's slice count plays
    ``samples_per_volume``'s (the amortisation factor), except that both are derived from
    the data rather than guessed.

    **Shuffling.** Blocks are shuffled, and samples are shuffled WITHIN a block, so batches
    mix slices and containers freely. What they do not mix is volumes from different
    blocks — a block is a group of co-resident volumes, typically one subject-contrast
    group's whole field ladder. Batch statistics therefore see many slices and several
    field pairings but a restricted subject set within any short window. That is the
    deliberate trade for making the sampling affordable at all; the alternative on this
    corpus is not "better shuffling", it is the central slice.

    Args:
        index_map: the dataset's ``(container_idx, slice_idx)`` list, positionally
            aligned with dataset indices.
        container_volumes: volume paths each container reads, from
            ``MRIxFieldsPairedDataset.container_volume_paths()``.
        max_resident_volumes: how many decoded volumes a worker may hold — the RAM bound.
            Must be at least the widest container's volume count or a block cannot be
            formed; that case raises rather than silently thrashing.
        shuffle: ``False`` gives a deterministic volume-major order (the validation case:
            reproducible, and it keeps a capped/visualised prefix stable across checks).
        seed: base seed; the epoch is mixed in via :meth:`set_epoch` so each epoch differs
            while staying reproducible.
