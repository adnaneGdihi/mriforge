"""Registry for config-declarable data transforms.

``data.processing.transforms`` is the YAML seam for "run this transform on
every subject". Before this module existed it was typed
``list[dict[str, Any]]`` with no validator, and its only consumer scanned the
list for the single literal string ``"graph_encoding"`` and ``break``\\ ed --
so every other entry was accepted by the schema and then silently discarded.
Arms named for a transform (``exp_slice_profile_sr``, ``exp_scas_8x_brain``,
the ``geomamba_ulf`` synthetic campaign) trained without it and reported
success. That is pitfall #16 (inert mechanism) sitting behind pitfall #15
(an advertised knob nothing reads).

Registry membership is now the validator, mirroring
``MetricsRegistry`` + ``check_metric_names_are_registered``: a name that is
not registered raises instead of vanishing, and every registered transform is
reachable from YAML.

Canonical home per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #12 -- transforms live in
``src/mriforge/data/transforms/`` and nothing else may define one.

Registering a transform::

    @register_transform("phase_residual", produces=("phase_residual",))
    class PhaseResidualTransform(tio.Transform): ...

Declaring it::

    data:
      processing:
        transforms:
          - name: phase_residual
            kwargs: {kernel_size: 9}
