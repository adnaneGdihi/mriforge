"""Collation Strategy Pattern - Data Loader SSOT.

Unified collation strategies for different data types:
- Images (2D/3D with padding/stacking)
- Graphs (variable node/edge counts)
- Sequences (variable length with masking)
- Mixed modalities (images + metadata)

Benefits:
- Clear separation of data type handling
- No image-specific logic leaking into graph data
- Reusable strategies across projects
- Type-safe via ABC pattern
