"""CS-MNO neural-operator generator.

Composes ``L`` ``CSMNOLayer`` blocks between a 1×1 lifting conv and
1×1 projection conv. The Hilbert permutation and per-token physical
Δt are pre-computed once at ``__init__`` from the spatial shape and
stored on the model as buffers.

Registered as ``"cs_mno_operator"`` with training mode
``"reconstruction"`` — the operator is a model architecture, not a
new training paradigm. The standard ``ReconstructionTrainingStrategy``
trains it like any other paired-input → paired-output model.

See ``docs/cs_mno.rst`` for math + usage and
``TODO/Mamba_NO.md`` for the full design spec (Theorems A and B).

        out_channels:     Output channel count (typically equals
                          in_channels for super-resolution / denoising).
        spatial_shape:    Tuple ``(H, W)`` for 2-D or ``(D, H, W)`` for
                          3-D. Permutation is precomputed for this

                          different shape the model will raise.
        n_layers:         Number of CSMNOLayer stacks.
        modes:            Spectral truncation modes per axis.
        dim:              Hidden width through the stack.
        d_state:          Mamba state dimension.

                          at construction time — no silent fallback.
        use_physical_arc: If True, scale the Mamba Δt by the physical
                          arc length of the SFC step (Theorem A).
        disable_spectral: If True, drop the FNO spectral branch from
