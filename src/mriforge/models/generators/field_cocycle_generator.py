"""Cocycle-consistent unified cross-field operator (MICCAI MRIxFields2026, idea 4.2).

A thin subclass of :class:`AnatomyFieldRenderer` that IS the shared-latent
factorisation of Theorem 6: ``G(x; s, t) = R(E(x), b_t)`` with a field-invariant
encoder ``E = Phi`` (the universal field-canonicaliser) and a continuous-field
renderer ``R(., b_t) = Psi_t``. The single-model / anti-ensemble property required
by Task 3 is therefore *structural*, not argued — recorded here as the registry
attribute ``is_unified_single_model = True`` that the ``field_cocycle_single_model``
Tier-1 guard reads. Beyond the parent it exposes ``last_canonical_repr`` = ``Phi(x)``
so the Tier-2 mechanism-fires probe can assert the canonicaliser was populated.

No new architecture: reuse keeps the parent's ``FieldFiLMBlock`` conditioning and
its magnitude-only 1->1 contract (pitfall #12 — one home per component).
