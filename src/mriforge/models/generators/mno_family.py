"""The five Mamba-Neural-Operator variants from ``TODO/Mamba_NO.md`` §3.

CS-MNO (the recommended combination) lives in
:mod:`mriforge.models.generators.cs_mno_operator`. This module ships the
remaining four variants as **registered model classes**, each a thin
wrapper around ``CSMNOOperator`` with the appropriate flag combination
preset. Adding them as separate classes (rather than YAML-only flag
flips) lets reviewers see the architectural identities cleanly in the
``EXPERIMENTS_YAML_CATALOG`` and lets the audit infer architecture
from ``model_type`` alone.

Mapping (spec §3 → flag combination):

================================================================
spec name          | scan_mode    | use_physical_arc | spectral
==================================================================
MNO-1 HS-MNO       | hilbert_2d   | False            | OFF
MNO-2 C-MNO        | hilbert_2d   | True             | OFF
MNO-3 ME-MNO       | hilbert_2d   | True             | ON  (with cubic-group averaging wrapper)
MNO-4 S-MNO        | hilbert_2d   | False            | ON
MNO-5 G-MNO        | metric SFC   | True             | ON  (geodesic-MST + DFS, image-domain)
=================================================================

CS-MNO (= C-MNO ⊕ S-MNO ⊕ Hilbert) is the proposed default; the four
alternatives ship as ablation/comparison baselines so a single
campaign can produce the comparative table from spec §5.
