r"""Physics-informed integration loss.

Moved here from ``src/infrastructure/physics/integration.py`` 2026-05-14
per ``TODO/backlog_ssot_and_layering_cleanup.md`` Phase 5 + CLAUDE.md
canonical-home rule (pitfall #12: ``@register_loss`` lives in
``src/models/losses/``).

The loss is a weighted sum of image-domain reconstruction error,
k-space data-consistency, and a placeholder regularization term — used
in physics-informed training where the model's output must both look
like the target image AND match the acquired k-space at the sampled
locations.
