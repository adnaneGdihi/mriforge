r"""Mutual-coherence penalty for a learnable sparsifying frame (A-6.5 *SCO-Frame*).

The coherence-optimisation half of A-6.5: a registered loss that drives the
off-diagonal of a frame's atom Gram matrix toward zero, so the learned atoms
become mutually incoherent. Mutual incoherence is a classical sparse-recovery
principle (low coherence certifies unique :math:`\ell_1` recovery for a *fixed*
dictionary, Donoho-Elad) but **that guarantee does not transfer to a learned,
task-specific frame** — here it is an *empirical* regulariser whose effect is the
testable ablation, not a recovery theorem. It is the **one-knob** of the
SCO-Frame ablation — turning ``lambda_coherence`` from 0 to >0 is the only change
between control and treatment.

For the atom matrix :math:`W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}` (``m`` unit-normalised
atoms :math:`\hat d_i`), the penalty is the Gram off-diagonal Frobenius energy

.. math::

    \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{coh}}=\sum_{i\neq j}\langle\hat d_i,\hat d_j\rangle^2
        =\lVert \hat W\hat W^\top - I_m\rVert_F^2 ,

which is 0 iff the atoms are mutually orthogonal and rises with coherence.

**Anti-facade contract (CLAUDE.md #16).** This is a *parameter* penalty on the
frame's atoms, not a ``(prediction, target)`` loss. Invoked without a frame /
atom tensor it **raises** — it cannot be silently dropped into a YAML ``losses``
block (which would call it ``loss(pred, target)`` and it would have nothing to
penalise). Wire it through the sparse-frame training strategy, which passes
``frame=`` and applies the ``lambda_coherence`` weight.
