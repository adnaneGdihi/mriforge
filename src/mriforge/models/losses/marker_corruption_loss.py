"""Marker-Anchored Corruption Loss for Virtual Fiducial training.

The core insight: **markers are known ground-truth geometry** placed in the
FOV before corruption.  By comparing the model's predicted marker region
to the known ideal marker, we directly measure how well the model has
learned to invert the corruption.  This corruption-inversion knowledge
transfers to the anatomy region.

Physics motivation:
    The Digital Twin embeds 4 corner markers at known positions with known
    intensities, then applies realistic scanner corruptions (B0, B1, motion,
    noise, chemical shift, eddy, spikes, crosstalk).  All corruptions affect
    the markers identically to the anatomy.  If ``G(corrupted)[marker_mask]``
    matches ``ideal_marker[marker_mask]``, the model has successfully learned
    the inverse of the corruption operator within the marker region.

Loss:
    L_marker = w₁ · |G(corrupted)[M] - ideal[M]|₁
             + w₂ · (1 - SSIM(G(corrupted)[M], ideal[M]))
