r"""Koopman-linearity (dynamic-mode-decomposition) residual loss for fMRI.

Koopman operator theory states that for a nonlinear dynamical system
:math:`x_{t+1} = F(x_t)` there exists a *linear* operator :math:`K` acting
on a lifted observable space :math:`\Phi`:

.. math::

    \Phi(x_{t+1}) = K\,\Phi(x_t).

This loss makes the ``koopman_fmri`` paradigm honour that mathematics rather
than degrading to a vanilla reconstruction term. Given a *temporal* sequence
(an fMRI volume series), it

1. lifts each spatial snapshot into the learned observable space
   :math:`\Phi` using the encoder of the existing primitive
   :class:`mriforge.models.temporal.koopman_operator.KoopmanMotionFilter`;
2. fits the best-fit linear Koopman operator :math:`K` to the prediction's
   *own* snapshots by least squares (the exact-DMD estimator
   :math:`K = Z_{+}\,Z_{-}^{+}`, where :math:`Z_{-} = [\Phi(x_0)\dots
   \Phi(x_{T-2})]`, :math:`Z_{+} = [\Phi(x_1)\dots\Phi(x_{T-1})]` and
   :math:`{}^{+}` is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse);
3. penalizes the linear-evolution residual
   :math:`\lVert \Phi(x_{t+1}) - K\,\Phi(x_t)\rVert`.

A sequence whose dynamics are genuinely linear in :math:`\Phi` (e.g. a
constant series, or one produced by propagating a state through a fixed
operator) yields a near-zero residual; an unstructured / nonlinear series
yields a positive one. The fitted :math:`K` is detached so the loss measures
*how far the prediction is from admitting a constant linear propagator*, not
how well a free matrix can memorise it.

    r"""Penalize departure from linear Koopman dynamics in observable space.

    Input layout: ``[B, T, H, W]`` where ``T`` is the temporal axis, or the
    equivalent ``[B, C, H, W]`` where the channel axis ``C`` is interpreted as
    time (fMRI frames stacked on channels). Both are 4-D and handled
    identically — axis 1 is the snapshot index. ``prediction`` and ``target``
    must share the same shape; a mismatch raises :class:`ValueError`.

    The loss is computed on ``prediction`` (the model's reconstructed series);
    ``target`` is accepted for API parity and not required by the residual.

            the least-squares fit for :math:`K` (numerical stability).
