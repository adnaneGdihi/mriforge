"""Loss Registry - decorator-based registry for loss functions.

This module provides a clean decorator-based API for registering and
accessing loss functions, following the same pattern as MetricsRegistry.

``@register_loss`` is the ONLY way in: ``create`` resolves against
``_custom_losses`` and raises on a miss. Earlier docstrings here described a
fallback to a ``UnifiedLossFunctionFactory`` for "built-in" losses -- that class
does not exist anywhere in the tree, and every loss including ``l1`` / ``l2``
arrives through the decorator. The promise of a second lookup path was the same
defect class as a knob with no reader (CLAUDE.md #15).

Example:
    >>> from mriforge.models.losses import create_loss, list_available
    >>> loss = create_loss("l1")
    >>> composite = create_composite_loss({"l1": {"weight": 0.5}, "ssim": {"weight": 0.5}})

AGNOSTIC_DOMAIN = "agnostic"

# Bridge the legacy free-string ``domain=`` plumbing (which predates the
# capability dataclasses) onto the closed ``Domain`` literal used by

#: ``domain=`` values that are deliberately NOT signal domains. These losses do
#: not grade the reconstruction signal at all -- they grade gradient waveforms,

#:
#: They previously fell out of the map above as ``domain=None``, which the block
#: check reads as "unannotated, skip" -- the right OUTCOME reached by accident,
#: and indistinguishable from a typo. Four losses sat there:
#: ``hamiltonian_energy_conservation``, ``gradient_hardware_compliance``,
#: ``bloch_consistency`` and ``bloch_signal_synthesis_consistency``. Carrying
#: them on ``domain_agnostic`` instead makes the pass deliberate, and protects
#: them from the same tightening of the ``None`` branch that ``AGNOSTIC_DOMAIN``
#: was introduced to survive.
