r"""Bottomley-derived contrast-consistency loss (XField-FM / idea 2).

Penalises predictions whose implied tissue T1 (under the standard
Bottomley closed form) disagrees with the prior table at the
acquisition's actual ``B0``. In other words: the network is allowed
to be wrong about the *image*, but it should remain physically
plausible about the *contrast*.

The proposal phrases this as a Bottomley-derived inequality
(``TODO/integration_plan_ulf_cheap_fast_mri.md`` §2.2). For a tissue
class :math:`c` and field strength :math:`B_0`, the prior gives a
target T1 :math:`\hat T_1^c(B_0)`. The loss is the mean-squared
deviation between the network's predicted (or fitted) T1 map and the
per-pixel prior, weighted by the tissue-class probability map.

Inputs
------
- ``predicted_t1_ms``: ``[B, 1, H, W]`` real tensor, the network's
  inferred T1 in milliseconds (typically derived from a relaxometry
  head or estimated from the contrast map).
- ``tissue_probabilities``: ``[B, K, H, W]`` soft tissue-class
  segmentation. Channels are ordered consistently with
  :class:`TissueClass` enum.
- ``field_strength_T``: scalar tensor or float — the acquisition's B0.

The loss is differentiable wrt ``predicted_t1_ms`` (so the network
learns to match the priors) and *constant* wrt the priors (the priors
are physical truth, not learnable).

    r"""MSE between predicted T1 and the Bottomley prior, tissue-weighted.

    Tagged ``mri_quantitative``: it grades a predicted T1 map in ms against the
    Bottomley field-strength-dependent relaxometry prior, so both the quantity
    and the prior are relaxometry. It raises on shape/channel mismatch rather
    than broadcasting.

    Args:
        weight: ``λ`` multiplier. Must be ≥ 0.
        tissue_order: Iterable of :class:`TissueClass` values matching
            the channel order of ``tissue_probabilities``. Defaults to
            ``(WHITE_MATTER, GRAY_MATTER, CSF)``.
        reduction: ``"mean"`` (default) or ``"sum"``.

    The loss is zero when the network's T1 prediction matches the
    Bottomley target everywhere the tissue probability is non-zero.

            \sum_{c} \int p_c(\mathbf r)
            (\hat T_1(\mathbf r) - \hat T_1^c(B_0))^2 \mathrm d\mathbf r
        }{ \sum_{c} \int p_c(\mathbf r) \mathrm d\mathbf r }

    where :math:`p_c` is the tissue-class probability for class
    :math:`c` and :math:`\hat T_1^c(B_0)` is the Bottomley prior.
