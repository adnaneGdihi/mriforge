"""Where ``mriforge profile`` writes, and what it records about how it ran.

Two responsibilities, both deliberately kept out of :mod:`mriforge.cli.profile_cli`
so they are testable without building an argparse namespace:

1. **Path resolution.** Every artifact a profiling run produces — the profiled
   run's own checkpoints/logs/metrics *and* the Scalene profile beside them —
   lands under ``experiments/results/<experiment>/profiles/<run_id>/``. That
   root is not a new convention invented here: ``config_health_checker`` already
   *requires* ``training.output_dir`` to be ``experiments/results/
   <experiment_name>``, so this module derives from that owner rather than
   becoming a second one (non-negotiable 17). ``resolve_experiment_name`` is the
   single place the ``<experiment>`` segment is decided.

   The ``profiles/<run_id>/`` nesting is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a
   profiling run is a THROWAWAY run of a real arm, and pointing it at the arm's
   own results directory made it overwrite the artifacts it was supposed to be
   measuring. See :class:`ProfilePaths` for the two roots that keeps apart.

2. **The manifest.** A profile that cannot be traced back to the modes that
   produced it is not evidence. ``cpu-only`` and ``full`` produce legitimately
   different numbers for the same arm, and ``--focus`` changes *which lines are
   reported at all* — so a bare ``scalene-profile.json`` sitting in a directory
   is ambiguous in exactly the way non-negotiable 14 exists to prevent. Every
   run therefore stamps ``profile_manifest.json`` recording the declared knobs
   beside what was actually executed (the literal child argv).

The provenance halves (git identity, interpreter/runtime environment) are
delegated to :mod:`mriforge.infrastructure.logging.provenance` — the framework's
existing owner for that — never re-derived here.

    Two distinct roots, and the distinction is the point:

    ``run_dir`` is the arm's REAL results directory — ``experiments/results/
    <experiment>`` — and is used only to *locate* the profile beneath it. Nothing
    is written there.

    ``child_run_dir`` is what the profiled child is told to write into. It sits
    at ``<profile_dir>/run/``, so a profiling run's checkpoints, logs, metrics
    and TensorBoard events are filed with the profile that produced them.

    They were the same path until this was fixed, which meant a 300-iteration
    profiling run wrote ``checkpoints/``, ``checkpoint_best.pt``, metrics CSVs
    and provenance directly on top of the arm's real results. Nothing announced
    it: the child's own config-health run reported the injected path as
    on-convention (``check_output_dir_convention`` is a *prefix* test), so a
    profiling run and a real run were indistinguishable after the fact. Keeping
    the two as separate fields means a future redirect has to say which one it
    means rather than picking up whichever is in scope.
