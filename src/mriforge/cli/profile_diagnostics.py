"""Explain a profiling run that died, instead of handing back a bare exit code.

A profiled run is expensive — the arm in issue #1486 was pacing at 59 s/iteration
— so when one dies the operator has already paid for it. ``Profiled run exited
245`` tells them nothing about whether to re-run the same command, change a flag,
or fix the arm, and the answer is not guessable: 245 is not a signal number, not
a Scalene exit code documented anywhere, and not stable across Scalene versions.

This module reads the failure out of the child's own teed log and names it. It is
a *classifier over observed evidence*, never a predictor: nothing here refuses a
run or changes what executes, so a signature that fails to match degrades the
error message and nothing else. That is deliberate — the known failure below is
**nondeterministic** (the same ``--mode cpu+gpu`` command on the same arm
succeeded the previous night), so a pre-flight refusal would block a mode that
demonstrably works.

**Anchors are library symbols, not human-readable banners.** The crash that
motivated this prints ``!!!!!!! Segfault encountered !!!!!!!`` on the cluster, and
that string appears nowhere in scalene 2.3.0 — the version pinned here — so the
banner's wording is a property of whichever Scalene build the run used. The
anchors below are C++ symbols owned by the *crashing* library (``torch``), which
is the half that does not move when Scalene is upgraded.
