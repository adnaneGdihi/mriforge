# ``inspect.signature(cls.__init__)`` — the right idea — but they also stripped
# ``betas``/``eps``/``momentum`` from the declared set before validating, on the
# assumption that ``_create_optimizer`` forwarded those itself. It only partly
# did, so ``optimizer_kwargs: {betas: [...]}`` was stripped here AND dropped
# there: two independent paths to the same silent loss.
#
# ``optimizer_resolution.resolve_optimizer_spec`` now owns the whole decision
# (which knobs exist, which the optimizer accepts, which were explicitly asked
# for), and it raises on a declared-but-unaccepted key instead of stripping.

        For callers that have parameters and a learning rate but no
        ``OptimizationConfigSchema`` (test-time adaptation, inner optimisation
        loops, INR fitting). Config-driven construction goes through
        ``resolve_optimizer_spec`` / ``build_optimizer_from_spec`` instead.

        **Which knobs reach the optimizer is decided by the registry's
        accepted-kwarg table, not by a family tuple here.** This method used to
        forward ``betas`` for ``adam``/``adamw``/``nadam``/``radam`` only, and
        ``weight_decay`` unconditionally -- verbatim the defect
        ``optimizer_resolution``'s module docstring says it was written to
        delete. Only the config path was converted, so the static factory kept
        the old behaviour and 13 of the 21 registered names were mishandled:
        ``lbfgs``/``rprop``/``sparseadam`` raised ``TypeError`` on the
        unconditional ``weight_decay``, while ``adamax``/``lamb``/``lion``/
        ``adam8bit``/``adamw8bit``/``schedulefree_adamw`` silently lost their
        ``betas`` and ``rmsprop``/``lars``/``schedulefree_sgd`` their
        ``momentum``. Forwarding is now signature-driven via
        :func:`accepted_optimizer_kwargs`, so a newly-registered optimizer works
        without editing anything here.

        ``alpha`` is deliberately NOT generalised, and that is not an oversight.
        It is the one name in this signature whose *meaning* is not portable:
        RMSprop's ``alpha`` is the squared-gradient smoothing constant (0.99),
        ASGD's is the power for its eta update (0.75). Forwarding by name match
        would quietly hand ASGD a smoothing constant as a decay exponent. The
        config schema has no ``alpha`` field for exactly this reason, so keeping
        it RMSprop-scoped is what agrees with the SSOT.

        Args:
            parameters: Model parameters to optimize.
            learning_rate: Learning rate. Forwarded unconditionally, as
                ``build_optimizer_from_spec`` does -- every registered optimizer
                accepts ``lr``.
            optimizer_type: Any name in the ``OptimizerRegistry`` (21 today),
                not just the four this docstring used to list.
            betas: Adam-family beta pair. Defaults to ``(0.5, 0.999)``; forwarded
                to every optimizer whose constructor accepts ``betas``.
            weight_decay: Weight decay. Defaults to ``0.0``; forwarded to every
                optimizer that accepts it, dropped for those that do not.
            momentum: Momentum factor. Defaults to ``0.9``; forwarded to every
                optimizer that accepts ``momentum`` (sgd, rmsprop, lars,
                schedulefree_sgd).
            alpha: RMSprop's smoothing constant. Defaults to ``0.99`` and is
                forwarded to RMSprop only -- see above.

        Returns:
            Optimizer: Created optimizer.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``optimizer_type`` is unknown, or if a knob the
                caller passed EXPLICITLY cannot be accepted by that optimizer.
                A knob left at its default is dropped quietly instead: the
                caller never asked for it, so silently honouring nothing is not

        run's losses is built by ``MixedPrecisionIntegrationHelper`` on the
        strategy (a ``NativeScaler``, or a ``ComplexGradScaler`` for complex
        arms) -- a different object, of a different class.

        The consequence was not a leaked allocation: ``CheckpointDirector``
        persisted ``scaler_state`` from the unused one, so every fp16 checkpoint
        carried an untouched scale of 65536 and a zero growth-tracker while the
        live scale was silently dropped. On resume the run re-converged its loss
        scale from scratch, overflowing and skipping steps for the first few
        hundred iterations -- with a ``scaler_state`` key present and restored,
        so the checkpoint looked complete.

        Kept as a no-op rather than deleted because it is a documented step of
        the public builder chain; ``CheckpointDirector._resolve_scaler`` is now
        the single reader.
