"""Reusable plateau-detection primitive.

A :class:`PlateauMonitor` tracks a single monitored scalar (a validation
metric or a training loss) and reports when it stops improving — a *plateau*.
It is the shared core behind two consumers:

* :class:`~mriforge.infrastructure.services.early_stopping.EarlyStoppingService`,
  which stops training on a plateau, and
* :class:`~mriforge.infrastructure.training.loss_schedule_controller.LossScheduleController`,
  which *acts* on a plateau (reweighting / enabling / disabling a loss term).

Before this module the plateau logic was reimplemented three times
(``EarlyStoppingService``, ``TrainingState.check_early_stopping``, and inline in
``PipelineMultiStageStrategy.on_epoch_end``) with divergent comparators. This is
the single source of truth.

Design notes
------------
* **Strict comparator.** Improvement is ``x < best - min_delta`` (MIN) or
  ``x > best + min_delta`` (MAX). A non-strict ``<=`` / ``>=`` treats a
  bit-identical flat metric as a fresh improvement every check, so the wait
  counter never grows and a plateau never fires — exactly the signature of
  identity-collapse / DC-blob runs. Strictness is the guard (pitfall #10).
* **Two usage levels.** :meth:`observe` is the low-level "record + count wait"
  call (``EarlyStoppingService`` layers its own stop decision on top via
  :meth:`is_plateaued`). :meth:`fire_if_plateaued` is the high-level
  "fire once per plateau, then suppress for ``cooldown`` checks" call the
  loss-schedule controller uses for repeatable triggering.
