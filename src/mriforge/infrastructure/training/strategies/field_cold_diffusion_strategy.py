"""Field-degradation cold diffusion (MICCAI MRIxFields2026, B-2.4).

Cold diffusion (Bansal et al. 2022) replaces Gaussian noising with an arbitrary
*deterministic* degradation. Here the degradation is **field down-conversion**: a
progressive low-pass whose cutoff shrinks from ``max_cutoff`` (t=0, sharp high-field)
to ``min_cutoff`` (t=T, ULF resolution loss). A restorer ``R_phi(x_t, t)`` is trained
to map each degraded image back to the high-field target, and the image is recovered
by the improved cold-diffusion sampling rule

    x_hat_0 = R(x_t, t);  x_{t-1} = x_t - D_t(x_hat_0) + D_{t-1}(x_hat_0).

Lineage: the project's experiment_11 cold diffusion uses a k-space-undersampling
degradation; this is the same algorithm with a field-down-conversion operator,
built self-contained on the physics SSOT (``fft2c`` via ``_lowpass_otf``) rather
than the k-space-specific machinery. Pure helpers hold the testable math.

SCOPE / LIMITATION: ``compute_field_cold_diffusion_loss`` trains the restorer to
invert a SYNTHETIC low-pass of the high-field **target** (it ignores ``batch['input']``).
At validation ``cold_diffusion_sample`` starts the reverse chain from the REAL ULF
``batch['input']``, which is not exactly a synthetic low-pass of the target (different
noise/contrast). Validation-on-real-ULF is thus a TRANSFER test of the restorer, and
the synthetic field-down-conversion is a surrogate for real ULF degradation — an
acknowledged approximation, not an implied exact train/val match.
