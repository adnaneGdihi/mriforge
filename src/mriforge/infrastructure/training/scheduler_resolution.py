"""LR-scheduler spec resolution — the single place a scheduler config is read.

Why this module exists (issue #533): ``OptimizationBuilder.build_schedulers``
used to read the scheduler config as ``scheduler["type"]`` and
``scheduler["kwargs"]``. Every experiment YAML in the corpus declares the block
*flat*::

    optimization:
      lr_scheduler_strategy: cosine
      scheduler:
        warmup_steps: 3500
        T_0: 50000
        T_mult: 2
        eta_min: 1.0e-06
        warmup_start_lr: 1.0e-06

226/226 ``inprogress`` configs declare neither ``type`` nor ``kwargs``, so every
parameter above was discarded and the built object was
``CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=100, eta_min=1e-6)`` — library defaults. Stepped once
per optimizer step that makes the LR sweep base<->eta_min with a
2*T_max*accum-iteration period for the whole run instead of annealing, and no
warmup ever ran.

Design (pitfall #15: read + validate + stamp, in the same change):

* the **flat** form is canonical (it is what the corpus uses); the legacy
  ``type``/``kwargs`` form still resolves,
* ``lr_scheduler_strategy`` is now *read* (146 configs declare the real type
  there and nothing consumed it),
* ``T_0``/``T_mult`` promote a ``cosine`` request to warm restarts, because that
  is the only factory that consumes them,
* ``T_max`` falls back to ``training.max_iterations``, never to 100,
* any key the resolved factory cannot consume **raises** — a typo or a
  wrong-family knob can no longer be silently dropped,
* the resolved spec is returned as a plain dataclass so callers can stamp it
  into provenance.
