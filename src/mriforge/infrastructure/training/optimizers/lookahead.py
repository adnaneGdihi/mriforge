"""Lookahead (Zhang et al., 2019) — a wrapper, not an optimizer name.

Keeps a slow copy of the weights and, every ``k`` steps, pulls the fast weights
toward it: ``slow += alpha * (fast - slow)``, then ``fast = slow``.

It is reached through ``optimization.optimizer.lookahead``, **not** through
``optimizer_type``, because a Lookahead with no inner optimizer is meaningless —
registering it under a name would advertise something unconstructible.

Moved here from ``gradient_stability.py``, where it was implemented, tested, and
completely unreachable from YAML: the only constructor that took ``use_lookahead``
was ``GradientStabilityManager.create_optimizer``, which had no production caller
anywhere in ``src/``. ``gradient_stability`` keeps a re-export so its existing
tests and any external import keep resolving.

One trap worth naming, because it is invisible until an LR schedule misbehaves:
``__init__`` builds a *copy* of the inner optimizer's ``param_groups``, and the
scheduler is attached to the WRAPPER. A scheduler stepping the wrapper therefore
writes ``group["lr"]`` on the copy, and the inner optimizer never sees it — the
run trains at the initial LR forever while the logs draw a perfect decay curve.
``step()`` closes this by syncing the wrapper's group hyperparameters onto the
inner optimizer before delegating (:meth:`Lookahead._sync_hyperparams_to_inner`).
