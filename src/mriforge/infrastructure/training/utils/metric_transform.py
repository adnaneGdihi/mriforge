"""Single resolver for the transform applied before validation metrics (#931).

Issue #931 reported ``metrics.transform`` as an inert knob with no reader.
Measurement says otherwise, and the difference decides the fix.

``MetricsMixin._compute_training_metrics`` -- reached from nine live strategies
(``diffusion``, ``gan``, ``vae``, ``reconstruction``, the two disentangled
strategies, ``field_cocycle``, and the ``adversarial`` mixin) -- passes the
``metrics`` block straight into ``_apply_metric_transforms``. So the knob *is*
read on the training-metrics path; the validation path reads
``validation.scoring.output_transform`` instead. Probed on the pre-fix tree:

===========================  =====  ==================
declared value               arms   behaviour
===========================  =====  ==================
``ifft_magnitude``              12   fires
``ifft_sense_adjoint``          57   fires
``ifft_mag_combine``           143   **silent no-op**
``ifft_mag``                     3   **silent no-op**
===========================  =====  ==================

What is dead is not the knob. It is the *spelling*: the dispatcher's
``if/elif`` chain has no ``else``, so a name no branch matches falls out of the
bottom and the tensors are returned unchanged. 146 arms name a transform that
does not exist and are told nothing.

**``ifft_mag_combine`` is deliberately NOT aliased to ``ifft_magnitude``.** The
two are operationally identical -- the implementation deleted in ``e57c21021``
was pair-R/I, ``ifft2c``, ``abs``, RSS, exactly today's ``ifft_magnitude`` --
so an alias is tempting and was the first thing tried. It is wrong here:
aliasing activates all 146, and **112 of them have ``losses.output_domain`` and
``infer_output_domain`` BOTH equal to ``image``**. Firing an IFFT on an image
output does not give those arms "what they declared", it gives them the Fourier
magnitude of an image. The declaration is a copy-paste from a k-space sibling,
not an intent, and the honest response to 146 arms naming a non-existent
transform is to say so (pitfall #9), not to guess which one they meant.

Precedence for the value that runs, highest first:

1. an explicit name handed in by the caller (``diffusion.py`` resolves its own);
2. ``validation.scoring.transform`` / ``validation.scoring.output_transform``.

``metrics_config`` contributes **suppression only** (``domain: none``); it never
supplies a name here. On the training path the metrics block arrives *as* the
first argument, which is how that path keeps reading ``metrics.transform`` --
unchanged from before this module existed.

**Declaring the winning key at all is the decision.** A source present but set
to ``none`` resolves to "no transform" and stops the cascade rather than
falling through. An *unset* field (Python ``None``) is absent and does fall
through.

``domain: none`` is a separate, stronger switch: it suppresses transforms
entirely, including the caller's auto-magnitude gate, and is reported as
``suppressed`` rather than as ``name is None`` because the two drive different
behaviour downstream.
