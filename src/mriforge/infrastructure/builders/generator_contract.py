"""What a generator constructor accepts, and which config fields never reach it.

Split out of :mod:`generator_kwargs` in the Wave 0 exit-criterion work (#1400).
Two things live here, and both answer the same question -- *may this name be
injected?* -- while ``generator_kwargs`` answers *what value does it get?*:

* :func:`resolve_contract` / :func:`accepts` -- the constructor's own signature.
* :data:`SKIP_MODEL_FIELDS` -- ``config.model`` fields that are not constructor
  parameters at all. Each entry records the arm it crashed when it leaked; do
  not prune one without reproducing that arm.
