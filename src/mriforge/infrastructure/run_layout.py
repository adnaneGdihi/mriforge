"""What inside a results tree is the arm's own output, and what merely lives there.

``experiments/results/<experiment>/`` is not homogeneous: alongside the arm's
real checkpoints, metrics and images, ``mriforge profile`` files a **throwaway**
run of that same arm under ``profiles/<run_id>/run/``. That child is a genuine
training run — it writes the same markers, the same ``metrics/real_images``, the
same ``final_metrics.json`` — so nothing about its *contents* distinguishes it
from the arm's own. Only its location does.

Every consumer that walks a results tree therefore needs the same predicate, and
this module is its single owner (non-negotiable 17).

Its placement is forced twice over. It cannot live in any of its three consumers:
:mod:`~mriforge.infrastructure.reporting.batch` imports
:mod:`~mriforge.infrastructure.reporting.pipeline`, which imports
:mod:`~mriforge.infrastructure.reporting.cases.loader`, so a constant shared by
all three would close a cycle. And it cannot sit anywhere inside
``infrastructure/reporting/`` either, even as a leaf: that package's ``__init__``
eagerly imports the whole pipeline, so ``cli/profile_paths.py`` importing from
there pulls torch, scipy, pandas and matplotlib into the ``--help`` path and
breaks ``test_startup_budget.py`` — measured, not assumed. ``infrastructure/``
itself has a deliberately empty ``__init__``, and dependencies point inward
(non-negotiable 5), so ``cli/`` may import this while the reverse could not.
