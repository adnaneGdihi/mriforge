"""Physics-informed pseudo-ground-truth synthesis for multi-rep MRI data.

Moved here from ``scripts/sim2rank/ground_truth.py`` 2026-05-14 per
``TODO/backlog_ssot_and_layering_cleanup.md`` Phase 4 — the
``src/cli/app.py`` meta-evaluation path was importing this from
``scripts/``, a layer-direction violation (CLAUDE.md pitfall #13:
nothing in ``src/`` may import from ``scripts/``).

Exploits the multi-repetition topology of the m4raw dataset to
synthesize an ultra-high SNR pseudo-ground truth by averaging
uncombined complex k-space across all repetitions, then reconstructing
via the SENSE adjoint.

Reference:
    Macovski (1996), "Noise in MRI", MRM — complex k-space averaging
    increases baseline SNR by sqrt(N_reps) prior to the non-linear
    magnitude operation.

    Multi-repetition merge is **NEX averaging in complex k-space** (Macovski 1996,
    *Noise in MRI*): averaging :math:`N` complex repetitions before the magnitude
    operation gives the full :math:`\sqrt{N}` SNR boost (magnitude-domain averaging
    would not, because of the Rician noise floor). The coil maps are the canonical
    7-step **ESPIRiT** (Uecker 2014) estimated from that high-SNR merged k-space.

        Y_{GT} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{reps}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{reps}}} Y_i
        \qquad

        rep_paths: Sorted list of H5 file paths for one anatomy group
            (all repetitions of the same contrast/subject).
        target_slice: If provided, extract only this slice index.
            Otherwise uses the central slice.
        device: Target device for output tensors.
        smaps: Optional pre-estimated ESPIRiT maps ``(1, C_coils, H, W)`` to
            **reuse** instead of re-estimating. The intended use is sim->real
            transfer: estimate ESPIRiT once from the NEX-merged multi-rep
            reference, then pass those maps when reconstructing each single-rep
            *degraded* acquisition so reference and degraded share ONE coil
            operator. The comparison then isolates the noise/averaging
            degradation rather than a per-acquisition recon-basis shift, and a
            single noisy rep never drives its own (poor) map estimate.
