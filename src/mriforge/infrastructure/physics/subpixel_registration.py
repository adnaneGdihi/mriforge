"""Differentiable sub-pixel translation and marker-anchored shift recovery.

Two primitives for multi-frame super-resolution:

``fourier_shift``
    Exact band-limited translation. A rigid shift is a pure linear phase ramp in
    k-space, so this is the physically correct sub-voxel dither operator. The
    ``grid_sample`` alternative low-pass filters by an amount that depends on the
    fractional part of the shift, destroying the high-frequency content that
    multi-frame SR exists to recover.

``estimate_subpixel_shifts``
    Wrap-free sub-pixel registration from the cross-power spectrum. Rather than
    unwrapping the phase or interpolating a correlation peak, it reads the shift
    off the phase difference between *adjacent* frequency bins, which is constant
    and small for any shift below the Nyquist limit.

Both operate on the centred FFT convention of ``fft_ops`` (DC at ``N // 2``) and
are differentiable end to end, so a network can be supervised through them.
