"""Faithful multi-acquisition synthesis for the VF field-mapping arms.

Several Virtual-Fiducial arms (AFI, double-angle, dual-echo) describe methods
that are mathematically defined over *multiple* acquisitions — two TRs, two
flip angles, two TEs — yet the single-frame VF pipeline feeds their models one
complex frame, so the method algebra runs on coil/real-imag channels instead
of the intended acquisitions (VF review, 2026-06-02; see
``docs/digital_twin_review_followups.rst`` Pass 5).

This module synthesises the genuine acquisition stack each method consumes,
**reusing existing, tested physics** — ``DifferentiableBlochLayer`` (steady-
state SPGR signal with explicit ``b1_map`` / ``b0_map``) and
``relaxation_priors.bottomley_t1`` (field-correct T1) — so nothing here invents
new physics. It generates a smooth ground-truth field, synthesises the
acquisitions from it, and returns both, so the field can be used as the
supervision target and the synthesis can be verified by a closed-form
round-trip (synthesise from a known field → run the method's inversion →
recover the field). See ``tests/unit/infrastructure/physics/test_multi_acquisition.py``.

        echoes: For ``dual_echo``, the two complex echoes ``[B, 2, H, W]``;
            ``None`` otherwise. Kept so the inversion is testable directly.
        shifts: For ``subvoxel_sr``, the ground-truth per-sample per-frame

            The oracle rung of the shift-knowledge ladder and the supervision
