"""Derivative-free fitting of a compounded degradation chain to a quality target.

scipy, not CMA-ES: ``scipy>=1.17`` is already a hard dependency and ``cma`` is not,
and ``differential_evolution`` takes the ``[0, 1]^K`` box natively with a seed. Adding
a dependency for this would be gratuitous.

Derivative-free rather than gradient-based because the interesting axes are not
differentiable in theta: line masks, spoke counts and partial-Fourier fractions are
discrete, and those are precisely the axes that dominate a low-field quality gap.

This module fits ATTRIBUTES only; it never sees a header. Voxel geometry is a header
fact to be imposed on the target grid, not a quantity to optimise -- fitting it
against a sharpness proxy would let a blur term absorb a geometry error and still
report a good residual.
