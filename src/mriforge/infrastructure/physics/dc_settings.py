"""One owner for "which ``physics.data_consistency`` key feeds which DC kwarg".

Three consumers used to answer that question, and only one of them was right:

* :mod:`mriforge.infrastructure.builders.generator_kwargs` forwards the SSOT
  block into the generator's ``**kwargs`` (the production path);
* :class:`~mriforge.models.generators.kspace_cold_diffusion_generator.KSpaceColdDiffusionGenerator`
  reads those kwargs back and dispatches to a concrete DC layer;
* the ``config_health_checker`` audit wants the same answer to decide whether a
  declared knob can possibly matter.

A second resolver does not announce itself -- both compute a plausible value and
the divergence surfaces as a wrong number, not an error (non-negotiable 17). So
the mapping and the "does this method read this knob" table live here, once.

Inert by method
---------------
``dc_weight`` is the term this module exists to make observable.
It is **not** a universal blend fraction: it is ``lambda_init`` (the trust
temperature) for :class:`SoftDataConsistency`, ``beta`` for
:class:`NoiseAdaptiveDataConsistency`, ``hf_lambda`` for
:class:`TargetAwareFSDC`, and ``weight`` for :class:`SimpleDataConsistency`.
:class:`HardDataConsistency` takes **no weight at all** -- its blend is
``(1 - m) * recon + m * obs``, which *is* weight 1.0 by construction, so there is
no coefficient for a declared value to occupy.

The same holds on the reverse path: ``p_sample`` and ``_apply_observed_dc``
(``models/diffusion/kspace_process.py:1508``, ``:1888``) both branch on
``dc_method == "hard"`` *before* reaching the ``self.dc_weight`` term, so a
declared weight is inert under ``hard`` at sampling as well as at training.

Declaring ``dc_weight: 0.5`` under ``dc_method: hard`` is therefore not a bug to
be honoured -- honouring it would silently convert hard DC into soft DC. It is a
knob that reads as a chosen experimental variable, is stamped into provenance,
and changes nothing (non-negotiable 8, pitfall #15/#16).
