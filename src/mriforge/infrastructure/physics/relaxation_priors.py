r"""Bottomley T1(B0) relaxation table (XField-FM / idea 2 §2.5).

Implements the closed-form approximation

.. math::

    T_1(B_0) = a \cdot B_0^{\alpha} + b

with tissue-class-specific coefficients per
Bottomley et al. *Med. Phys.* 1984 [1] and the Marques 2019 update
[17] for low field. Coefficients are stored as a frozen dataclass —
not user-editable — to preserve cross-paper reproducibility.

The Bottomley table feeds:

- The contrast-consistency loss in idea 2.
- The Bloch-constrained ULF→HF translator in idea 3.
- The Tier-2 ``_probe_field_conditioning_diverges`` audit, which
  cross-checks the network's predicted contrast change against the
  Bloch-simulated change.

Coefficients are quoted *for white matter, gray matter, and CSF in
brain*; extending to other tissue classes is a follow-up.
