"""Spatial-frequency band partition keyed to what an acquisition actually resolved.

A super-resolution network is asked to produce detail the low-field acquisition
never measured. Nothing in a global PSNR/SSIM number distinguishes detail that
was *recovered* (present in the aliased multi-frame measurements, and unfolded)
from detail that was *fabricated* (a plausible prior, unconstrained by data).
Separating the two needs a frequency axis anchored to the acquisition, not to
the storage grid.

The anchor here is the normalised radial frequency

.. math::

    \\rho(\\mathbf{f}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\left(f_i / f^{c}_i\\right)^2},
    \\qquad f^{c}_i = 1 / (2\\,\\Delta^{\\mathrm{eff}}_i),

where :math:`f_i` is in cycles/mm and :math:`\\Delta^{\\mathrm{eff}}_i` is the
resolution the *scanner* achieved on axis *i*. By construction:

* ``rho <= 1`` — inside the acquisition passband. Measured, up to noise.
* ``rho > 1``  — **super-Nyquist**. Not measured. Any content here is either
  unfolded from inter-frame aliasing or invented.

Normalising per axis makes the boundary exact under anisotropy: the ULF
protocol resolves 1.6 mm in-plane and 5.0 mm through-plane, so the true
passband is an ellipsoid and a scalar cutoff would misclassify whole bands on
the thin axis.

Two ways to state the passband, both explicit:

``voxel_mm`` + ``effective_voxel_mm``
    Real data. The volume is stored on the 3 T grid (0.22-0.49 mm) while the
    64 mT scanner resolved 1.6-1.7 mm, so grid spacing is NOT resolution.
``sr_scale``
    The synthetic decimation path, where frames are ``s``-fold pooled views of
    the HR grid. Then :math:`\\Delta^{\\mathrm{eff}} = s\\,\\Delta^{\\mathrm{grid}}`
    exactly and ``rho = 2 s |f|`` with ``f`` in cycles per HR pixel.
