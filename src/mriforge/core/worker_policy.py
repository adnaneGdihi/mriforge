"""Dataloader worker policy — one CPU-share rule, shared by every loader.

``num_workers`` was a flat read of the YAML with no topology term anywhere on
the path, so N ranks on one node each spawned the full declared count:
``num_workers: 8`` on a 4-GPU node with ``--cpus-per-task=16`` meant four
trainers plus **32** decoder processes competing for 16 cores. Step time went up
rather than down -- one of the reasons a multi-GPU run could come out slower than
the single-GPU baseline it was meant to beat.

This module owns the rule; :mod:`mriforge.core.topology` owns the facts it reads.
The separation matters because the rule is a *policy* with a compatibility
contract (see :func:`clamp_worker_count` on why it is a ceiling), while the
topology is an observed fact about the process.

    The declared value is a **ceiling, never a floor**. This function can only
    ever return a number ``<= declared``, which is what makes it safe to apply
    everywhere: an arm that already fits its allocation is untouched, so the
    ``# OOM fix`` arms that deliberately lowered ``num_workers`` keep the value
    they chose, and a single-rank run whose workers fit its cores is unchanged.

    What it fixes: ``num_workers`` was a flat read of the YAML with no topology
    term, so N ranks on one node each spawned the full count — ``num_workers: 8``
    on a 4-GPU node meant 32 decoder processes competing for 16 cores, and the
    step time went up rather than down.

    Args:
        declared: The configured ``num_workers``.
        topology: The resolved run topology.
        role: ``"train"`` / ``"val"`` / ``"inference"``, for the log line.
        log: Emit the clamp / unknown-CPU log lines. ``False`` for the
            provenance re-derivation, which asks the same question a second
            time in order to record the answer and must not narrate it twice.

    Returns:
        The :class:`WorkerDecision`. ``workers`` is ``0`` iff ``declared`` is
        ``0`` — a declared ``0`` means "load in the main process", a deliberate
        choice (and ``validation.loader``'s default), so it passes through
        untouched. The floor is otherwise ``1``, which is what makes the
        ``num_workers=0 + persistent_workers=True`` combination that torch
        raises on unreachable by construction.
