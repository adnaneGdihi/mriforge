"""Single source of truth for every environment variable MRIForge reads.

The list mirrors `.env.example` at the repo root. Each constant is the name
of the variable; the helper functions are thin wrappers around
``os.environ.get`` / ``os.getenv`` that return parsed defaults so call sites
don't repeat the literal name + default everywhere.

Usage::

    from mriforge.core import env

    data_root = env.data_root()                  # str path, with fallback
    if env.suppress_clinical_warning():
        ...

Adding a new env var requires three lines: a constant in
:mod:`mriforge.core.env_names`, a `.env.example` entry, and a getter here (if it
has a parsed type).

The constant must also be listed in that module's ``__all__`` — :func:`names` is
derived from this module's ``__all__``, which is spliced from the registry's, so
a constant that is declared but not exported is invisible to every consumer
*and* to the tests that check `.env.example` coverage. That is exactly how
``MRIFORGE_GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION`` stayed unadvertised while its own resolver
claimed it was "registered in core/env.py". The guard needs two tests, not one:
``test_env.py::test_all_constants_are_exported`` scans ``vars(env)`` and so can
only see constants that were successfully re-exported, while
``test_env_names.py::test_all_constants_are_exported`` scans the registry itself
and catches the one that never left it.

Scope note: the registry registers names, this module reads them. Consumers keep
their own ``os.environ.get`` calls and their own defaults; several are read for
bare truthiness rather than through :func:`as_bool` (see ``MRIFORGE_DEBUG``), so
do not assume a uniform parse just because a name appears here.
