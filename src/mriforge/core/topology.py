"""Run topology SSOT — how many ranks, on how many nodes, with what hardware.

Every distributed decision in this codebase needs the same few facts, and
before this module each one re-derived them locally and disagreed:

* the training loop read ``max_iterations`` with **no** ``world_size`` term, so
  a 4-GPU ``torchrun`` ran all 30 000 iterations on *every* rank — the ranks did
  not split one experiment, they each ran the whole experiment. Wall-clock was
  therefore mathematically >= the single-GPU run, which is how an arm came to be
  *slower* on four GPUs than on one;
* dataloader workers were a flat read of the YAML, so ``num_workers: 8`` on a
  4-rank node meant 32 decoder processes competing for 16 cores;
* five separate "am I rank zero?" implementations existed, plus three wrappers;
* the GPU *allocation* was read in one place and stamped into ``provenance.json``
  beside the live world size, where nothing ever compared them -- so a
  ``--gpus=4`` job that launched one rank trained for 41 minutes with three cards
  idle and nothing in the package objected (#1274).

This module owns those facts, and only those facts. The rules that *consume*
them live at their consumers: the worker ceiling in
:mod:`mriforge.core.worker_policy`, the iteration budget in the training loop.
Resolution is a
pure function of ``(environ, cpu_probe, path_exists)`` so every branch is
unit-testable on a laptop with no GPU and no scheduler, mirroring the design of
:mod:`mriforge.core.compute_device`.

**Rank zero is two different questions.** ``is_rank_zero`` is the single owner
for the whole *job* (persistent artifacts: checkpoints, TensorBoard, the run
bundle). ``is_local_rank_zero`` is the single owner per *node* (node-local
scratch in ``/tmp``, per-node caches). Collapsing them into one
``is_main_process`` is the mistake this API exists to prevent: on a multi-node
run, a job-global artifact written by every local-rank-zero silently produces
one file per node, and which one survives is a race.

**Neither predicate means "skip on other ranks."** Under FSDP/DeepSpeed a
state-dict gather is a *collective*: every rank must enter it and exactly one
rank writes the result. Gating the whole block on ``is_rank_zero`` hangs the
job. See the comment at ``pipelines/training_loop.py`` on ``may_checkpoint``.
