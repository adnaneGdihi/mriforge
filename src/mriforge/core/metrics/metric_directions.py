"""Single source of truth for metric *optimization direction*.

Every metric in the registry must expose a boolean ``higher_is_better``
attribute — it is part of the :class:`~mriforge.core.metrics.registry.IMetric`
protocol and is consumed by the reporting layer (training-curve direction,
results tables, ablation strips) and by the meta-evaluation ranker
(``metric_adapter`` previously defaulted a *missing* attribute to ``False``,
which silently ranked PSNR/SSIM as "lower is better").

Two ways a metric declares its direction:

1. **Self-declared** — the metric class sets ``higher_is_better`` itself
   (class attribute or property). ~22 metrics do this today. These own
   their value and are NOT listed here (a direction is defined exactly
   once, never duplicated).
2. **Centrally declared** — for the large family of metrics that subclass
   ``BaseMetric`` (which historically defined no direction), the value
   lives in :data:`METRIC_HIGHER_IS_BETTER` below and is injected onto the
   class by the ``@register_metric`` decorator at registration time.

This map lives in ``core/`` (the architectural home for metrics) because
``core/`` may not import ``scripts/``, where the sim2rank ``METRIC_SPECS``
list independently annotates direction. ``METRIC_SPECS`` is a downstream
consumer; ``tests/unit/core/metrics/test_metric_directions.py`` asserts the
two never disagree, so this map remains the single source of truth.

Adding a new metric: either set ``higher_is_better`` on the class, or add an
entry here. The registry gate tests
(``tests/contracts/test_metric_registry.py``,
``tests/unit/core/metrics/test_metric_registry_health.py``) fail loudly if a
registered metric ends up with neither.
