"""Core evaluation metrics implementation.

This module serves as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for evaluation metrics
used across the codebase, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and others.

This module deliberately writes NO environment variables. It used to run, at
import time::

    os.environ.setdefault("TMPDIR", "/tmp/<username>")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        os.environ["TORCH_CUDA_EAGER_CACHE_MANAGER"] = "1"

All three parts of that were wrong (#1250):

* the path hardcoded one developer's username, and ``/tmp`` is sticky, so on a
  shared cluster node the directory belongs to whoever created it first;
* ``TMPDIR`` is tier 2 of ``env_resolver.resolve_cache_root``, so a metrics
  import silently redirected the framework-wide cache root -- and whether it
  won depended on import order, which no caller controls;
* the assignment sat BELOW this module's own ``import torch``, where PyTorch
  has already read those variables, so it was inert even on its own terms.

``main.py`` owns this bootstrap: it calls ``configure_cache_environment()`` and
sets ``TORCH_CUDA_EAGER_CACHE_MANAGER`` unconditionally ABOVE ``import torch``,
and every entry point reaches it (``cli/app.py`` imports ``mriforge.main``).
Declare ``TMPDIR`` or ``MRIFORGE_CACHE_ROOT`` in ``.env`` to steer the cache
root; do not re-add a writer here.

    INPUT_SIGNATURE : str
        Declares the expected input contract so the dynamic metric loop
        in :class:`EvaluationMetrics` can skip metrics whose input
        contract does not match a standard ``(pred, target)`` image
        pair. Valid values:

        * ``"image_pair"`` (default) — both inputs are 4-D image tensors
          ``(B, C, H, W)``.
        * ``"landmark_pair"`` — both inputs are arrays of landmark
          coordinates ``(K, ndim)``; e.g. TRE.
        * ``"displacement_field"`` — ``preds`` is a dense displacement
          field ``(B, ndim, *spatial)``; ``target`` is ignored or also a
          field; e.g. folding-fraction, DVF-MAE.
        * ``"volume_3d"`` — ``preds`` is at least 3-D spatial; e.g.
          through-plane FWHM.
        * ``"distribution"`` — requires accumulation across many samples;
          e.g. FID, KID, FRD, MedFID, MMD, sliced-Wasserstein.
        * ``"sequence_temporal"`` — requires a time/repetition axis;
          e.g. ICC(3,1), Bland-Altman LoA across replicates.
        * ``"perfusion_curves"``, ``"diffusion_dwi"``, ``"flow_3d"``,
          ``"spectrum"`` — domain-specific signatures.

        The dynamic metric loop in :class:`EvaluationMetrics` only calls
        metrics with ``INPUT_SIGNATURE == "image_pair"`` to avoid
        propagating spurious NaN values into report tables (regression
        of the 2026-05-05 NaN-tables bug).

    REQUIRES_MATCHING_SHAPES : bool
        When ``True`` (default) :meth:`forward` raises on a pred/target
        shape mismatch instead of letting the subclass broadcast. Set it
        ``False`` only on a metric that *deliberately* consumes a wider
        prediction than its target — e.g. a distribution head scored by
        ``gaussian_nll``, which slices ``[mean, logvar]`` itself.
    ALLOWS_UNEQUAL_SAMPLE_COUNT : bool
        Set ``True`` on a distribution-vs-distribution metric to free the
        leading sample axis while keeping every trailing dim checked. This
        is the correct opt-out for unequal cardinality; clearing
        ``REQUIRES_MATCHING_SHAPES`` for that purpose disables the guard

    """Foreground-restricted PSNR for MRI — a **different quantity** from ``psnr``.

    An MRI slice is mostly black air. Whole-image PSNR therefore spends most of its
    average on background the model gets right for free, which flatters a
    reconstruction whose anatomy is poor. This metric restricts the error to the
    tissue support so the object dominates the score.

    **It is expected to disagree with** :class:`PSNR`, and the disagreement is the
    point — do not "reconcile" them. Measured on a phantom that is 76% background:
    noise injected *only* into the air region drops whole-image ``psnr`` to 18.2 dB
    while this metric stays at its perfect-match sentinel, because the anatomy was
    untouched. Under uniform noise it reads ~2 dB below ``psnr``, tissue-only error
    being the harder average. ``psnr`` is canonical; this is the one to monitor when
    the claim is about anatomical fidelity rather than whole-frame reproduction.

    Addresses three critical issues in MRI PSNR computation:
    1. Background Zero-Inflation: Only computes PSNR on tissue regions
    2. Data Range Hallucination: Uses robust target range (percentile) as data_range
    3. Magnitude Support: Handles complex-valued MRI data correctly

    This metric prevents artificially inflated PSNR scores caused by:
    - Thousands of "correct" zero-predictions in background air regions
    - Single-pixel outliers (DC spikes) that inflate the data range
