"""Powered ranking certification — the finite-sample gate for pairwise verdicts.

This is the executable counterpart of the Lean theorems
``Sim2Rank.powered_sample_size`` / ``Sim2Rank.sample_size_for_recovery`` /
``Sim2Rank.pool_deviation_union_bound`` (``docs/lean/Sim2Rank/Sim2Rank/Powered.lean``)
and the paper's Corollary 5.2. It closes the gap raised in the meta-evaluation
critique §3 ("asymptotic-only theorems with no closed-form sample-size formula").

Theory
------
For a bounded rank-correlation statistic (Kendall / Spearman — the ADR ``rho``,
LGDR, and CDSCR rankers) computed on ``N`` i.i.d. evaluation samples,
Theorem 5.1(3) gives the misordering bound

    P(s_hat_A <= s_hat_B) <= 2 * exp(-m * Delta**2 / 8),   m = floor(N / 2),

for two metrics with population score gap ``Delta = s_A - s_B > 0``. Inverting the
bound (this is exactly what the Lean ``powered_sample_size`` proves):

    * to *certify* a pair at confidence ``1 - alpha`` the gap must clear
        Delta >= sqrt(8 * ln(2/alpha) / m)                  (gap threshold)
    * equivalently the sample size must satisfy
        N >= 2 * ceil(8 * ln(2/alpha) / Delta**2)           (critique eq. 2)

:func:`certify_partial_order` refuses to assert any pairwise ordering whose
observed gap falls below the powered threshold, and reports only the certified
partial order plus the ambiguous (statistically indistinguishable) pairs.

Exactness regime
----------------
The bound's sub-Gaussian proxy ``c = 1/m`` is exact for statistics bounded in
``[-1, 1]`` (rank correlations). For other bounded scores it is conservative; for
unbounded scores (KSG MI) it does not apply — see limitation L7/L14 in the paper.
The ``gap_threshold`` returned here is therefore calibrated for the
rank-correlation scale, and is most meaningful for rankers whose raw score is a
bounded concordance statistic.

    bound is over **pairs**, not the ``K`` metrics: with per-pair misorder
