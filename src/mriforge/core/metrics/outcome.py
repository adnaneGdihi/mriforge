"""Outcome vocabulary for a metric evaluation: scored / not-applicable / crashed.

A sweep that scores ~164 metrics across ~28 degradations must not conflate three
outcomes:

* **OK** — the metric ran and produced a number.
* **NOT_APPLICABLE** — the metric is *undefined* on this input (an ROI smaller
  than its receptive field, a required mask that was not supplied, a k-space
  measurement that an image-space crop cannot restrict). This is a legitimate,
  expected outcome and carries a machine-readable reason.
* **CRASHED** — the metric raised. This is a **defect**, not a result.

Collapsing all three to a bare ``float("nan")`` — as the sim2rank engine did —
makes a genuine crash indistinguishable from "this metric does not apply here",
so a broken metric reads as an honest N/A and is never fixed. That is pitfall #9
(silent fallback) wearing a numeric disguise: the leaderboard still renders, the
run still exits zero, and the metric simply never scores.

The rule this module enforces: **a number is only ever returned when a metric
actually computed it.** Everything else is NaN *plus a reason*.
