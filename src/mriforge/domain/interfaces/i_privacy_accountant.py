"""Privacy-accountant protocol.

Implements ``CC`` interface for ``PR-7 / H5`` of
``TODO/backlog_paradigm_expansion_roadmap.md``: a Rényi-DP accountant
for tracking the cumulative privacy loss across DP-SGD rounds.

A privacy accountant tracks a *privacy budget*: each call to
:py:meth:`step` records a sub-sampled Gaussian mechanism with the
given noise multiplier and sample rate; :py:meth:`get_epsilon` then
converts the accumulated Rényi divergences into an ``(ε, δ)``-DP
guarantee.

Implementations live under ``src/mriforge/infrastructure/services/privacy/``.

    Implementations should:

    - Permit different noise multipliers / sample rates across calls
      (heterogeneous schedules are common).
    - Fail loud (no silent saturation) when the budget would exceed
      the ``target_epsilon`` configured by the caller.
