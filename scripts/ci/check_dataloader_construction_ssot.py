"""Pre-commit / PR gate: a ``DataLoader`` is constructed in ONE place.

Non-negotiable #7 (data SSOT): File->Dataset/DataLoader code lives under
``src/spectramr/data/``; everything else consumes via ``DataPipelineDirector`` and
never calls ``DataLoader(...)`` itself. Before the 2026-08 data-layer audit
(finding D22) there were four construction sites under ``src/spectramr/``, and they
had drifted apart in exactly the way duplicated construction always does: one read
a plain ``dict`` instead of the frozen config, two omitted the per-worker
``worker_init_fn`` seeding, and three hardcoded ``prefetch_factor`` /
``persistent_workers`` past the schema fields that exist to set them.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/check_dataloader_construction_ssot.py

Exit codes:
    0 -- every loader construction under ``src/spectramr/`` is allow-listed.
    1 -- a new construction site appeared, or an allow-list entry went stale.

Why AST and not grep
--------------------
A line scanner for ``DataLoader(`` is wrong in both directions, and the count IS
the gate. **False positives**: ``class IDataLoader(ABC)`` is a class definition
and ``consolidated_dataset_factory.py`` names the symbol inside a docstring
mermaid diagram -- neither constructs anything. **False negatives**: the symbol
is reachable under many spellings (bare, fully-qualified, and the aliased
``_DataLoader(`` in ``data/builders/data_loader_builder.py``); a pattern
enumerating two of the three reports "clean" while the third walks past.

Why subclasses, and why a generated vocabulary (#1362)
------------------------------------------------------
Until 2026-08 this gate matched the *name* ``DataLoader``, so ``tio.SubjectsLoader``
-- a real ``DataLoader`` subclass, four construction sites under ``data/`` -- was
invisible, and with it the one site that never seeds its workers. Fixing that by
adding ``SubjectsLoader`` to a hardcoded list would have re-committed the exact
mistake this docstring warns about one paragraph up: the vocabulary would again
be an enumeration of the spellings someone happened to think of. It is instead
**discovered** -- ``refresh_dataloader_binding_names.py`` imports the repo's
dependencies, walks the transitive ``DataLoader.__subclasses__()`` closure, and
records every attribute name those classes are reachable under, into
``dataloader_binding_names.txt``. Reading that file needs no torch, so the gate
still fits the ``guards`` job's dependency-free contract (checkout +
setup-python, no pip install).

That the vocabulary must be discovered is not a hypothetical. Hand-reasoning it
produced ``{DataLoader, SubjectsLoader, ThreadDataLoader}``; discovery returns
five, because monai re-exports the torch loader as ``TorchDataLoader`` and
``_TorchDataLoader``, names that appear in no class ``__name__``.

Known false-positive mode, deliberately kept
--------------------------------------------
An attribute call whose head cannot be resolved (``anything.DataLoader(...)``)
matches on the final name alone. The corpus has no such site today, and the
polarity is the one this repo wants: loud-wrong beats silently-blind.
