"""Unit tests for meta_evaluation figure rendering.

Focused on the intensity-scaling contract of the degradation mosaic
(``fig12_degradation_mosaic.png``). Two independent defects were rendering that
figure unreadable, and each needs its own guard:

1. **No shared scale.** Every panel called ``imshow`` with no ``vmin``/``vmax``,
   so matplotlib autoscaled each panel to its own min/max. A mosaic whose entire
   purpose is to show a θ progression is meaningless when every cell has its own
   contrast — a brighter panel can look *cleaner* than a dimmer one.
2. **No robust clipping.** The pipeline normalises by the 99th percentile, not
   the max, so the top ~1% of voxels runs far above the bulk. Autoscaling to the
   max maps the anatomy into the bottom ~1% of the colormap: a black brain.

These tests assert the *display range*, which is the seam that actually decides
whether the brain is visible, rather than re-checking matplotlib's own plotting.
