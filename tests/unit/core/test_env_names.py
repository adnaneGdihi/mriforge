"""Unit tests for the env-var NAME registry.

``env_names`` was split out of ``core/env.py`` in the Wave 0 exit-criterion work
(#1400). The split creates a blind spot that these tests exist to close.

``test_env.py::test_all_constants_are_exported`` scans ``vars(env)``. After the
split, a constant declared in this module but omitted from *its* ``__all__``
never reaches ``env`` at all -- so that test cannot see it and passes vacuously.
The same scan has to run against the registry itself, or the split would have
quietly disabled the guard that caught ``SPECTRAMR_GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION``.
