"""Run-topology resolution: how many ranks, on how many nodes, how many CPUs.

Context: ``experiment_11_attention_none`` ran SLOWER on four GPUs than on one.
The cause was that ``training.max_iterations`` is a per-rank loop bound with no
``world_size`` term, so every rank ran the whole 30 000-iteration experiment;
the aggravating factor was ``num_workers`` having no topology term either, so a
4-rank node spawned four times the declared decoder processes. This module is
the SSOT those decisions were missing. The clamp itself is a separate policy
(``core/worker_policy.py``) and is tested in ``test_worker_policy.py``.

Style note: these tests pass ``environ=`` / ``cpu_probe=`` / ``path_exists=``
explicitly and use **no** monkeypatch, mirroring
``tests/unit/core/test_compute_device.py`` rather than ``test_env.py``. That is
deliberate -- ``resolve_run_topology`` takes an injected mapping precisely so
every branch is testable without a scheduler, a GPU, or a container. It also
matters here because there is no global autouse fixture that snapshots and
restores ``os.environ`` between tests, so a module that leaned on ambient
environment state would leak into its neighbours.
