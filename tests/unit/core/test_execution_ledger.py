"""Tests for the runtime substitution ledger.

Every case here is a **sensitivity pair**: one config where the knob survives
and one where it is dropped, asserting the ledger stays quiet on the first and
fires on the second. That polarity is the point. Issue #550 shipped a blocking
gate that reported ``defects: none`` for all 47 arms it was written to protect,
and it passed review because its tests only ever asserted the clean case. A
detector tested only against healthy input cannot be distinguished from a
detector that never fires.

This mirrors the ``WIRED``/``FACADE`` control groups in
``tests/unit/config/test_knob_behaviour.py``, for the same stated reason: a
suite where every case is expected to fire cannot tell "the defect is real"
from "the harness is stuck on".
