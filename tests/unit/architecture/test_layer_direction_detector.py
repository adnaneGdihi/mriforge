"""Planted violations for the layer-direction fitness function (NN15, #1398).

``tests/architecture/test_layer_direction.py`` was elected sole owner of import
direction, and the five ``emit`` blocks that enforced it in
``scripts/ci/check_layering.sh`` were deleted in the same change.  An election is
only safe if the winner is watched catching what the loser caught, so every rule
this table carries is planted here -- **in both shapes**, because shape is the
whole reason the election went this way:

* **top-of-file, column 0** -- the only shape the deleted greps could ever see
  (each was anchored at ``^``).
* **function-local, indented** -- structurally invisible to those greps.  The two
  real violations the election surfaced are exactly this shape, both at col 8 in
  ``application/use_cases/hpo_use_case.py`` (#1398).

The tests below therefore come in pairs: ``test_detects_*`` asserts the plant is
caught, and ``test_removing_*`` mutates the rule table and asserts the same plant
goes UNCAUGHT.  A plant no mutation kills is not a demonstration.
