"""Integration test for the sim2rank native-data path (M4Raw, 2026-05-25).

Mirrors the glue that ``sim2rank.py`` performs on real data: synthesize the
pseudo-GT (real complex coil images + ESPIRiT maps), sweep with
``return_complex=True``, SENSE-combine the GT, and feed the real coil maps +
complex (phase-bearing) images to the engine. Pins that the native path
actually engages — phase + g-factor differ from the FourierBridge fallback —
and runs on CUDA when available (the canonical backend).

Skipped when the M4Raw H5 data is unavailable (e.g. CI), so it's a local /
cluster regression guard rather than a hard dependency.
