    Two properties that the pure-predicate tests above cannot cover:

    1. The guard reads the ``core.resources`` probes -- the same implementation
       ``RunTopology`` stamps into provenance. If it re-read the environment
       itself, the ``RunTopology`` GPU fields would be reporting-only decoration,
       the exact anti-pattern ``core/resources.py`` was created to end. The patch
       targets below are what pins that: they are the core functions, not a
       launcher-local helper.
    2. It runs UPSTREAM of the ``model_copy`` that overwrites ``num_devices``
       with the observed rank count. Downstream of that, the declaration a reader
       would compare against is already gone.
