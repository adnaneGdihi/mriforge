"""D01#4 (callee half): ablation must be able to represent "no device requested".

``spectramr ablation`` parses ``--device`` with ``default=None``, but the CLI then
did ``or "cuda"`` before calling in, because every function on the ablation path
was typed ``device: str = "cuda"``. Removing the CLI fallback without widening
the callees would have replaced a hardcoded device with a lie in the signature.

``None`` is not "CPU" -- it means *the config, then the 9b resolver, decides*,
which is exactly what ``run_training_pipeline(device: str | None = None)`` at
the end of the chain already accepted.
