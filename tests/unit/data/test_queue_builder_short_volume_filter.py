"""Regression test for F10/E35 (smoke_audit_20260521 round 5) —
``TorchIOQueueBuilder`` must drop subjects whose spatial extent is
smaller than the configured ``patch_size``.

Root cause: ``stage2_ldm_ulf_to_hf`` (and similar 3D experiments)
crashed with ``5D target_batch has a zero-sized dim: shape=(1, 1,
128, 128, 0)`` because ``tio.UniformSampler`` silently produced
empty patches when a manifest volume had fewer Z-slices than
``patch_size[2]``. The strategy's error message suggested manually
filtering the manifest; F10 implements that filter generically at
the queue-build layer.

Fix: ``TorchIOQueueBuilder._filter_patch_compatible_subjects(dataset,
patch_size)`` walks every subject, inspects its image data shape,
drops those with any spatial extent < corresponding patch size.
Returns the original dataset unchanged when nothing was dropped
(preserves SubjectsDataset transform behavior).

Tests:
- 2-D patch_size keeps all subjects (no z constraint).
- 3-D patch_size drops subjects with insufficient z.
- Empty-result case still returns a valid dataset.
