"""Non-finite guard in ``ImageCollateStrategy.collate`` (finding M3).

The guard used to log at ERROR and then ``torch.nan_to_num(value, nan=0.0)``,
returning the batch anyway — training continued on fabricated zeros, which the
dataset layer explicitly declines to do (``data/datasets/contrast_aware.py``
refuses the identical substitution four times over).

Infinities were mishandled two different ways, both silent, because the old guard
was gated on ``torch.isnan(value).any()``:

* tensor carries inf but no NaN -> the guard never fired, so the inf was neither
  logged nor touched and flowed into the model unchecked;
* tensor carries both -> ``nan_to_num`` fired, and since ``posinf``/``neginf``
  default to ``None`` (meaning "replace", not "leave alone") the inf was rewritten
  to the dtype's largest finite value, ~3.4e38 for float32, while the log line
  spoke only of NaNs.

It now raises ``ValueError`` on either. ``data.collation.validate_nans: false``
remains the opt-out and means "pass values through unmodified", never
"silently repair".
