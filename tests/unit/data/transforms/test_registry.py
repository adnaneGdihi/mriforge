"""Contract tests for the config-declarable transform registry.

The registry exists because ``data.processing.transforms`` was typed
``list[dict[str, Any]]`` and its only consumer matched the single literal
``"graph_encoding"`` and stopped -- every other declaration validated at load
and was then silently discarded. These tests pin the three properties that
keep that from recurring: an unregistered name raises, every registered
transform is constructible, and the keys live strategies read have a producer.
