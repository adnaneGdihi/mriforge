"""Tests for :class:`mriforge.data.datasets.preprocessed_dataset.PreprocessedMRIDataset`.

Regression coverage for DC-2: ``_apply_split`` used to return the *full*
sample list for any split string that was neither ``'train'`` nor ``'val'``
(the ``else`` branch). A typo such as ``split='test'`` would then silently
train on the entire dataset — a NN#3 / pitfall #9 silent fallback. The fix
raises ``ValueError`` for unknown split values.
