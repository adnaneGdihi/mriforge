"""Transform parity contract: inference transforms must match training transforms.

The motivating bug: today, training data flows through
:func:`TorchIOTransformBuilder.build_train_transforms`
(e.g. ``rss_image`` coil combine, k-space normalization, etc.), but
inference uses :class:`InferenceDataset` which applies its own
"minimal" preprocessing path. Two consequences:

1. A model trained on ``rss_image`` 1-channel image data can silently
   receive raw 2-channel complex k-space at inference, producing
   garbage outputs that no test catches.
2. Anti-aliasing / resampling / coil compression applied during
   training is silently dropped at inference time.

Per the data-layer unification plan (Phase 2), inference will route
through ``DataPipelineDirector.build(mode="infer", ...)`` with a
strict_train_parity check that diffs the resolved transform chain
against the one recorded in the checkpoint metadata.

This test pins that contract as an ``xfail`` for now — it documents
what should be true once Phase 2 lands. When the parity machinery
exists, this test flips to ``xpass`` and we promote it to a regular
``pytest`` test by removing the ``xfail`` marker.
