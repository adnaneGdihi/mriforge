"""Invariants every degradation axis must satisfy, checked on all 31 at once.

These are *cross-axis* contracts, deliberately separate from the per-axis physics
assertions in ``tests/unit/infrastructure/physics/test_digital_twin_extensions.py``.
The distinction matters: a per-axis test asks "does gibbs ring?", these ask "is every
axis a well-formed severity coordinate?" — and the second question is what sim2rank
actually depends on, because it grades metrics by their *response* to theta.

The invariants, and the failure each one exists to catch:

1. **Finite everywhere.** A NaN anywhere in a degraded image poisons every metric
   computed from it, and a metric that returns NaN is recorded as ``never_computed``
   rather than as a crash — so the axis silently drops out of the ranking.

2. **Scale-invariant severity.** ``theta`` must mean the same damage regardless of the
   caller's units. D2 ``rician`` violated this until 2026-07-27 (``sigma = theta * 0.3``
   as a literal intensity): ``sim2rank.py`` sweeps the RAW coil-combined magnitude and
   divides by ``raw_p99`` only afterwards, so on fastMRI brain (p99 ~ 1e-4) the noise sat
   four orders of magnitude above the signal and the axis was destroyed at theta=0.05.
   Nothing crashed; ``psnr`` simply sat on its -30 dB floor at every severity level.
   **This is the test that would have caught it, and it catches the whole class.**

3. **Monotone in theta.** If severity does not increase with theta, ADR/SROCC/isotonic
   are all measuring noise, and a metric can score well by tracking the wrong direction.

4. **Materially degrading.** An axis that barely moves at theta=1 contributes a
   near-random column to every cross-axis mean (#223 — the magic-angle no-op).

Severity is measured as scale-free relative L2, ``||x - D(x)||^2 / ||x||^2``, which is
dimensionless by construction — so invariant 2 is a statement about the *operator*, not
about the units the assertion happens to use.
