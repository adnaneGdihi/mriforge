"""Parallel-strategy plugins: dispatch, ordering, and no silent fallbacks.

``strategy: 'fsdp'`` used to be accepted by nothing. ``apply_parallelism``
implemented ``none``/``dp``/``ddp`` in an if/elif and raised ``ValueError`` on
anything else -- *after* the whole training environment had been built -- while
FSDP was reached through a separate ``parallel.fsdp.enabled`` flag read in
``ModelBuilder``. The spelling the reference template advertised was the fatal
one, and the one that worked read as "no parallelism".

The ordering assertions matter more than the dispatch ones. FSDP wraps in
Stage A because ``FSDP.__init__`` re-points parameter storage into a flat shard:
an optimizer built first receives shard-shaped gradients against full-shape
moment buffers. DP/DDP wrap in Stage B because they do not change parameter
identity and everything downstream expects a bare module.
