"""Plotting-SSOT ratchet guard.

Figures must be produced ONLY inside ``src/mriforge/infrastructure/reporting/``
(the plotting SSOT), with two sanctioned second surfaces — the sim2rank
meta-evaluation figures and dataset EDA — plus a frozen baseline of pre-existing
emitters kept out of scope by the report-only consolidation. The test fails on any
NEW figure-emitting call added elsewhere under ``src/mriforge/`` so plotting cannot
drift back out of the reporting pipeline (the ``no_new_*`` ratchet pattern).
