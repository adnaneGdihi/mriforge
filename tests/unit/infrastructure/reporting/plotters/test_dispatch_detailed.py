"""Paired tests for ``plotters.dispatch_detailed``.

``dispatch`` collapsed three unrelated situations into a bare ``None``: the
figure id was not registered, the plotter raised, or the plotter reported it had
nothing to draw. All three then wrote the same ``status: skipped`` manifest
entry. They call for different responses -- fix the id, fix the plotter, or
accept that this run has no such data -- so they are recorded separately.

This is what makes a report after `predict` comparable to one after training.
The requested figure set is identical for both (it derives from the task preset,
never from the caller), so the only difference is which figures had data; unless
that is written down, the difference reads as an unexplained absence.
