"""``_load_strategy_class`` reports the LOAD, not every lookup (issue #619).

The import is cached by ``sys.modules``, but the ``logger.info("Loaded strategy:
...")`` line was not, and several independent callers resolve the strategy in one
process: ``ConfigHealthChecker.check_contrast_conditioning_*``,
``validation.context_resolver``, and ``ModelInitializer``. Every cluster job log
therefore carried two or three "Loaded strategy: DiffusionTrainingStrategy" lines
and read as a repeated import.
