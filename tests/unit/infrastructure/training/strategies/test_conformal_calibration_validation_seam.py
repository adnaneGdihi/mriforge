"""Regression: b17_dice_risk_calibration must survive validation to emit its certificate.

``ConformalCalibrationStrategy`` runs ``anatomy_field_renderer``, whose ``forward`` takes
``field_strength`` as a REQUIRED keyword-only argument. The pipeline's gated validation
seam forwards a batch key only when its name literally appears in the strategy's
``validation_step`` signature (``_VALIDATION_FORWARD_FIELDS`` in ``pipelines/train.py``).

The strategy did not override ``validation_step``, so it inherited a signature that names
neither ``field_strength_target`` nor ``contrast_id``. The seam dropped both, the renderer
was called bare, every validation batch raised TypeError, the loop hit "Validation produced
zero successful batches", and the run died BEFORE ``_maybe_run_calibration`` — so the
Dice-risk RCPS certificate, this arm's entire deliverable, was never written.
