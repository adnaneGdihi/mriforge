"""Regression: PrivilegedLearningStrategy must BUILD its teacher and domain
discriminator in ``_setup_strategy_specific_components`` and register the
discriminator's params on ``env.opt_g``.

Pre-fix bug (2026-05-31 audit): the strategy read ``self.env.teacher`` and
``self.env.domain_discriminator`` — neither of which is a field on the frozen
:class:`TrainingEnvironment`, so the first training step raised
``AttributeError`` — and ``_setup_strategy_specific_components`` was a bare
``return``, so nothing was ever built. The fix builds a frozen teacher copy of
the student and a :class:`DomainDiscriminator` (stored on ``self`` because env
is frozen), and adds the discriminator params to ``opt_g``.

These tests drive the setup hook with a stub env (real ``opt_g`` SGD over a
dummy param, a tiny ``nn.Module`` student) and assert:

1. the teacher + domain discriminator exist after setup,
2. the discriminator params land in ``opt_g.param_groups``, and
3. the domain-adversarial loss actually flows gradient to those params.
