    Rewritten 2026-07-14 (issue #189). This test used to grep the source for the
    strings ``"conformal data-consistency is SKIPPED"`` and ``_warned_no_dc`` —
    i.e. it asserted that the *degrade* path still existed. The strategy has since
    been upgraded to fail loud: without those batch keys the conformal DC step
    cannot run, the loss collapses to an ordinary Gaussian-denoising MSE, and the
    "conformal" paradigm is inert while the run smoke-PASSes (pitfall #16). So the
    source outgrew the test, which then pinned the very degradation the repo
    forbids — and had been red on ``dev`` ever since.

    Asserting behaviour rather than source text: a string-grep test cannot tell a
    warning from a raise, which is exactly the distinction that matters here.
