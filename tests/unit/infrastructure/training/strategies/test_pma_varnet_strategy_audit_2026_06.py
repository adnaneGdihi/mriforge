"""Regression tests for the 2026-06 audit fixes on ``ConcretePMAVarNetStrategy``.

Covers the ``pma_varnet_strategy`` section of the 2026-05-31 strategy audit
(see ``TODO/strategy_audit_2026_05_31_unreviewed_findings.txt`` and
``TODO/_high_triage_full.txt``).

Findings status:
- [critical] Simulator 3-tuple destructured in wrong order (line 96): ALREADY
  FIXED upstream (commit abe98aafb). A source-level guard test below locks in
  the corrected unpack so a regression cannot silently re-swap the tuple.
- [high] Marker-pinning loss fed swapped tensors (lines 159-164): corollary of
  the above; guarded by the same source-level test.
- [medium] Ad-hoc ``torch.manual_seed`` in ``validation_step`` (line 194):
  FIXED here — the reseed is removed; ``validation_step`` no longer clobbers
  global RNG state (the val path is a deterministic ``no_grad`` forward and
  determinism is owned by ``initialize_accelerator``).
- [low] SSIM ``.item()`` + bare except: DEFERRED — the defect locus is
  ``models/losses/m4_losses.py``, not the strategy file under review.

    """The medium finding: ``validation_step`` must not reseed global RNG.

    The fixed method is a thin ``no_grad`` forward; it must leave the global
    CPU RNG state untouched so it does not clobber the accelerator's seeding
    contract (performance.md). We invoke the method against an UNINITIALIZED
    real instance that stubs out ``_unpack_batch`` and ``_compute_losses_impl``,
    so the test exercises only the RNG behaviour of ``validation_step`` itself.

    A bare ``SimpleNamespace`` used to serve as that fake ``self``. It stopped
    working when #1190 wired the val path's ``model_output`` snapshot, because a
    duck-typed stub silently pins the method's ENTIRE ``self.`` surface: any new
    ``self.<helper>`` call breaks it, whether or not the behaviour under test
    changed. ``object.__new__`` keeps the real helpers (``snapshot_source``,
    ``_capture_model_output``) reachable while still constructing nothing --
    ``env.generator`` is ``None``, so the capture registers no hook, stashes
    nothing, and emits nothing.
