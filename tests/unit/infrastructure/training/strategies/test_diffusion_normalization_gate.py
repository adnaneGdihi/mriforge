"""An identity ``kspace_scale`` must not read as "already normalized".

``DiffusionTrainingStrategy`` decided whether the data pipeline had normalized a
batch by asking whether ``kspace_scale`` was present. Two very different batches
answer yes:

* ``KSpaceNormalizationTransform`` publishes the scale it divided by.
* ``M4RawRepetitionDataset`` publishes an identity ``kspace_scale = 1.0`` to say
  "the data leaves the dataset unnormalized", so the published scale always
  matches the tensor served beside it.

Reading presence as evidence skipped ``apply_kspace_normalization`` on exactly
the second kind, and the model trained on raw k-space with the ~200x
DC-vs-periphery range that ``enable_log_scaling`` exists to compress.

``experiment_11_attention_none`` recorded this: its step-6 snapshot has the batch
reaching ``train_step`` at ``abs_max 2406.9``, and a float32 ``log1p`` output
cannot exceed ``ln(FLT_MAX) ~ 88.7`` — so that batch was provably never
compressed.
