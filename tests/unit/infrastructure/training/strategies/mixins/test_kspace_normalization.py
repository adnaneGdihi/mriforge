    tensors. Do not divide again!". The ``else`` branch recomputes a scale from a
    hardcoded 0.99 quantile of the input and divides input AND target by it.

    Reaching the marker required ``isinstance(batch_data, dict)`` or

    branch -- compressing an already-compressed tensor by a quantity that is not
    even the scale training used (training honours the declared
    ``kspace_percentile``; this branch is pinned at 0.99).

    The compression is ``log1p``-domain, where a division does not commute with
    the ``expm1`` the renderer applies, so the later multiply-back cannot undo it.
