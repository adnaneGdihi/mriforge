"""Regression tests for the 2026-06 strategy-audit fixes to
``qsm_pipeline_strategy`` (audit section ``### qsm_pipeline_strategy``).

Findings addressed here:

* [high|silent-fallback] The blanket ``try/except Exception`` in
  ``_compute_losses_impl`` swallowed any ``run_pipeline`` failure into a
  constant, grad-free ``loss_qsm_pipeline_error`` tensor, so QSM silently
  degraded to a no-op recon while smoke looked green (pitfall #10). The fix
  removes the catch so failures propagate and audit/smoke fail loudly.
* [low|silent-fallback] The same catch bound ``e`` but never logged/raised it,
  masking the diagnostic. Resolved by removing the catch.
* [critical|correctness-bug] (already fixed in-tree, pinned here as a
  regression guard) ``compute_field_map`` is called with all four required
  positional args — two single-echo phase maps plus two scalar echo times —
  not the old 2-arg call that raised ``TypeError``.
