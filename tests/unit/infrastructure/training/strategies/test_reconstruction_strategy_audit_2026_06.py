"""Regression tests for the 2026-06 audit fixes to ``ReconstructionTrainingStrategy``.

The shared reconstruction base is exercised only through full training/validation
forwards (it needs a built environment), so these tests pin the audit fixes by
introspecting the control flow rather than spinning up a generator:

* an enabled PINN module that errors must re-raise (not silently drop the term);
* a model advertising ``forward_with_intermediates`` that errors must re-raise
  (not silently lose its deep-supervision path);
* validation must use a deterministic timestep (random draw was non-reproducible).
