"""A6: the domain-adversarial term must not fabricate its own labels.

``privileged_learning_strategy.py`` read the per-sample domain label as
``batch.get("domain_label", 1)``. No dataset under ``mriforge.data`` emits that
key -- the A6 census found it among 60 batch keys with no data-layer producer --
so the default always won and every sample in every batch was labelled domain
``1``. The gradient-reversal discriminator was therefore trained to separate one
class from itself.

This is the census's single **substitutes** case, and it is worse than the 33
keys whose absence merely skips a term: a skipped term is absent, but here the
mechanism is present, running, and wrong. The BCE loss is well-defined and
finite, so it plots a plausible curve while the domain signal it exists to supply
is identically uninformative. ``training.privileged.delta`` defaults to ``0.1``,
so the branch was ON by default, and both corpus arms that select this strategy
were training the confounded objective.

See ``TODO/inprogress/a6_orphan_batch_key_triage_2026_08_06.md``.
