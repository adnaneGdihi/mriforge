"""Guard tests for ``SCASStrategy`` (finding D11).

SCAS *is* the scout-conditioned acquisition mechanism. ``_prepare_generator_inputs``
used to ``return inputs`` unchanged whenever ``batch['scout']`` was absent, so
the hypernet was never built, never joined ``opt_g``, and neither ``scas_mask``
nor ``scas_logits`` was ever written -- which in turn made the density penalty in
``_compute_losses_impl`` silently no-op. The arm degenerated to plain LOUPE under
the SCAS name (pitfall #16).

Nothing could produce ``scout``: ``ScoutAcquisitionTransform`` had no way to be
constructed until the transform registry landed. The guard now raises and names
the producer.
