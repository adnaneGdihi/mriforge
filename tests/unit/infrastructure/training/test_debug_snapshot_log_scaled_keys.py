"""Per-key ``log_scaled`` in debug snapshots (experiment_11 blurry-target triage).

``data.processing.enable_log_scaling`` is an ARM-level fact: it says the pipeline
compresses k-space with ``log1p`` somewhere. It does NOT say that every tensor a
given snapshot captured is on the compressed side of that transform, and the two
base-strategy emitters routinely capture tensors that are not: ``first_steps``
holds the batch as the dataloader delivered it, and the generic ``model_output``
snapshot pairs the generator's (compressed) output with ``target``/``input`` as
they entered ``train_step``, i.e. before ``apply_kspace_normalization`` runs.

Decompressing an uncompressed tensor is not a rounding error. ``expm1`` is
applied per-bin under a clamp at ``DECOMPRESS_MAGNITUDE_CEILING``, so every
coefficient above it collapses to the SAME magnitude while its phase survives —
the IFFT then renders a phase-only image: ringing, washed-out interior, no
low-frequency content. On experiment_11_attention_none that made a perfectly
good ground-truth k-space render as a blurry non-brain and sent the triage after
the M4Raw loader, which was never at fault.
