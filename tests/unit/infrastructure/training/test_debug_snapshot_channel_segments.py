"""Mixed-domain ``model_input`` renders (experiment_11 ``model_input`` crosshair).

The cold-diffusion strategy builds the tensor the network is actually fed by
concatenating two DIFFERENT domains on the channel axis
(``strategies/diffusion.py``, ``torch.cat([noisy_images, smaps], dim=1)``):

* channels ``0:2C``  -- the degraded k-space ``x_t``, real-stacked
  ``(R0,I0,R1,I1,...)`` and ``log1p``-compressed by the arm's
  ``data.processing.enable_log_scaling``;
* channels ``2C:4C`` -- the coil sensitivity maps, real-stacked in the SAME
  layout but **image domain** and never compressed.

Both halves are even-channel real-stacked float32, so nothing about the tensor
distinguishes them. ``strategies/base.py`` lists ``model_input`` in its
``_canonical`` authoritative-k-space set, which by construction bypasses the
spectrum veto and applies ``expm1`` + ``ifft2c`` to all four coil-map channels
as though they were a spectrum.

The IFFT of a smooth, DC-dominated image-domain field is a separable sinc-like
kernel: a bright centre pixel plus a horizontal and a vertical ridge. After the
RSS combine that cross carries the overwhelming majority of the frame's energy,
and ``_render_image_preview``'s closing per-sample min-max then divides the whole
picture by that spike -- so the genuine zero-filled brain in the other half is
crushed to near-black. On ``experiment_11_attention_none`` this rendered
``model_input.png`` as a black frame with a white dot and a crosshair, and read
as "the model input is worse than a zero-filled image" when the k-space actually
handed to the network was fine. The defect is in the RENDER, not the data.

Note what is NOT the fix: narrowing ``log_scaled_keys`` (forbidden outright by
``utils/kspace_view.py``) would leave the wrong ``ifft2c`` in place, and slicing
the recorded tensor down to its k-space half would break the debug-snapshot
contract's requirement that the artifact show the REAL model input
(``docs/debug_snapshot_contract.rst``, CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 14). The tensor
is genuinely 16-channel; only its rendering has to become domain-aware.

**Update (#1327).** The maps half is no longer image-domain: it now reaches the
concat through ``prepare_smaps_for_kspace_conditioning``, which ``fft2c``s it,
RMS-matches it to the k-space half and amplitude-caps it. So it DOES need the
``ifft2c`` now -- but it still never passed through the arm's ``log1p``, and
``expm1`` on an uncompressed spectrum clamps every bin above
``DECOMPRESS_MAGNITUDE_CEILING`` to one value: the magnitude is flattened, phase
survives, and the render is a washed-out ringing artifact. Deriving "was it
compressed" from "is it k-space" therefore stopped working, which is why a
segment carries an optional fourth field. The crosshair story below is the
ORIGIN of the mechanism, not its current shape.

    """``log_scaled_keys`` rides the same sidecar as the segments, or it is lost.

    The cold-diffusion step records the concatenated maps under BOTH a standalone
    ``smaps`` key and a ``model_input__smaps`` segment -- the same tensor twice.
    The segment carries its own compression answer; the standalone key can only
    be corrected through ``log_scaled_keys``, so if the declaration drops it on
    the way to the writer the two renders of one tensor disagree, which is
    strictly worse than both being wrong.

    Read-before-clear is the specific trap: the sidecars are cleared in the same
    breath as the declaration triple ("never pin one step's tensors").
