    """Which predictions save as a bit-exact black PNG, and which do not.

    A black `fake_*.png` beside a clean `real_*.png` is the single most common
    "the model collapsed" report on the cold-diffusion arms, and it is read as a
    magnitude problem: the prediction is off-scale, so the image saturates away.

    That reading is wrong, and it sent the 2026-08-16 experiment_11 triage down
    a false mechanism before these cases were measured. `_normalize_images` does
    percentile windowing (0.5% / 99.5%, foreground-aware), NOT min-max, so an
    out-of-range but FINITE prediction still renders across the full 0-255
    range. Bit-exact black is a much narrower signal than "too big".

    2026-08-17: narrower still, and now always reported. The first version of
    this class pinned FOUR black cases and thereby documented two renderer bugs
    as expected behaviour:

    * a sample containing a single NaN went black, because `torch.quantile`
      propagates NaN through the whole window — one bad pixel destroyed 65k
      good ones. The window is now taken over finite pixels only;
    * a healthy sample whose dynamic range fell below an ABSOLUTE `1e-8` floor
      went black, so the same image in smaller units rendered differently. The
      degeneracy test is now relative.

    What remains black is only what carries no renderable content — all-zero,
    constant, all-NaN — and each of those now emits a WARNING, because a
    black PNG is otherwise indistinguishable from a legitimate render and
    nothing downstream registers the failure (pitfall #16).

    2026-08-18: that taxonomy gained a FIFTH, legitimate cause, and it is not
    visible from this class. Every case here saves the same tensor as both real
    and fake and asserts on the REAL png, which is always windowed by its own
    percentiles. The fake is now drawn under the real's window instead, so a
    perfectly healthy, non-constant prediction lying entirely below that window
    clamps to bit-exact black — and entirely above, to solid white. Neither is
    constant nor non-finite, so none of the tests below can see it. It is
    detected and reported separately; see
    ``TestTheFakeIsRenderedUnderTheRealsWindow``. Read a black *fake* against
    the shared window recorded in its sidecar, not against this list.

    ``_normalize_images`` fits its window to the tensor it is given, so windowing
    real and fake separately re-fits the affine map to whatever each side happens
    to contain. Intensity error is then absorbed by the very transform that is
    supposed to display it: a prediction 4x too bright comes out **byte-identical**
    to the ground truth (measured, below). That is pitfall #16 exactly — the
    artifact looks like evidence and is not — and it is why experiment_11's
    validation figures read as "fine" while the fake mean was 197.7 against a real
    mean of 55.1.

    healthy non-constant fake outside the shared window clamps flat, which the
