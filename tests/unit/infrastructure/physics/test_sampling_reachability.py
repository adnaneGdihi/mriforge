"""Registered, reachable, firing — the three claims, kept separate.

Registering a family is the easy half. This repo is registry-dispatched and
YAML-driven, so a family can be registered, imported, tested and merged and still
never run for a config. The claims and what settles each:

* **registered** — the name is in the registry: a same-process membership check;
* **reachable** — a config can resolve it: a COLD SUBPROCESS that has not
  pre-imported the accelerator modules, driving the production path;
* **fires** — the mask actually degrades the tensor, not merely that nothing
  raised.

The cold subprocess is the one that separates registered from reachable: a
same-process test may have imported the module itself, proving nothing about what
a config would see.
