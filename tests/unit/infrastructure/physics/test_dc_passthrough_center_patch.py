"""Regression tests for ``dc_passthrough_center_patch``.

Background
----------
The cluster's iter-2 cross-contrast cold-diffusion PNG showed a bright
central "white spot" superimposed on the brain. Diagnosis (see
docs/validation_image_audit.rst):

  * Raw k-space spans 5+ decades of magnitude, dominated by the DC bin.
  * Percentile normalisation flattens the bulk but leaves DC untouched —
    the percentile is *designed* to ignore that tail.
  * ``AdaptiveDataConsistency`` eventually learns ``λ ≈ 1`` at DC, but
    starts random — iter-0/iter-2 outputs leak ~50% of the CNN's random
    DC error, rendering as a central blob.

The fix is to skip-connect the central patch deterministically: at
sampled bins (mask=1), replace the CNN output with the measurement.
Unsampled bins inside the patch keep the CNN's value (we can't know
them better than the network does). ``λ ≡ 1`` on the patch, by
construction.

These tests pin that contract.

    validation DC blob, but it does the opposite while the CNN's

    low-pass point-spread function centred on the array — the blob.
