# Behavioural conformance: the declared axis vs what the degrader DOES.
#
# The tests above pin the *declarations*. They cannot fail when a degrader's physics
# is wrong, because they never call one -- they re-type the literal from the signature
# and compare it to the spec. Transcription is not verification, and the gap let four
# broken axes into the SSOT:
#
#   partial_fourier    theta=0 returned a BLACK image. `mask[..., -cut:, :] = 0` with
#                      cut == 0 is `mask[..., 0:, :] = 0` (-0 == 0) -- the whole mask.
#                      FIXED here.
#   chemical_shift     the shifted fat was added on top of the FULL water signal, a
#                      (1 + fat_fraction) gain, so theta=0 came back 1.35x bright and
#                      rel-L2 DECREASED as severity rose: an inverted axis, on which
#                      every L2-family metric (PSNR/NMSE/MSE) scores backwards.
#                      FIXED here (water/fat partition).
#   concomitant_phase  a pure image-domain phase. |x * exp(i*phi)| == |x|, and the sweep
#                      grades .abs() -- so it is exactly zero-degradation at every theta.
#   magic_angle        likewise flat at every theta (T2 modulation, MSK-only).
#
# The last two are INERT: they contribute a flat axis on which every metric scores
# identically at every severity, so they cannot separate any metric from any other --
# pitfall #16 at the axis level. They are recorded as strict xfails below rather than
# skipped, so the day one of them starts doing something, this suite says so.
#
# Every one of these is a plausible-null: nothing crashes, the leaderboard just means
# nothing. These tests call the degraders.
