"""Unit tests for the workflow maturity ledger's registry-walk.

The ledger is the anti-facade spine: it asserts each ``WorkflowProfile``'s
declared maturity against the live registries. That only works if the walk
itself is honest, which it was not before 2026-07-16:

  - ``strategies_tagged`` read ``capabilities`` via ``getattr``, which walks the
    MRO — so 64 strategies reported ``workflows={mri_structural}`` while exactly
    one declared it (the leak tests below).
  - ``_iter_strategy_classes`` swallowed every import exception, so a broken
    strategy silently vanished from the walk instead of raising (pitfall #9).

These tests pin both. They are unit-level and touch no GPU.
