"""The three legacy stacks, republished through one gate.

These assert the *union*, which is the whole point. Before this, `bootstrap` ran
`ValidatorRegistry` and had never run `ConfigHealthChecker`; `_audit_one` ran
`ConfigHealthChecker` + `compatibility_matrix` and had never run
`ValidatorRegistry`. Both directions were real, so neither surface was a superset
of the other and the union was what nobody checked.
