"""Tests for the failed-profiling-run classifier.

The point of a classifier is that it *discriminates*, so every recognition test
here is paired with a near-miss that must NOT match. A signature matching its own
motivating log proves nothing on its own — a matcher hardcoded to return the one
known failure would pass that test and be worse than useless on the next crash.

The recognized fixture is a verbatim excerpt of the crash as it was actually
emitted (a cluster run of ``experiment_11_attention_none`` on 2026-08-24), not a
paraphrase: a fixture written from the docstring agrees with the docstring by
construction and stops testing the producer.
