"""Tests for :mod:`tests.utils.dropped_key_baseline` (issue #1053).

The baseline's whole value is that it stays a RATCHET rather than becoming a
waiver. So the tests that matter are the ones that fail if it quietly turns into
"everything is allowed": an unrecorded pair must still be reportable, and the
recorded set must keep describing real arms.
