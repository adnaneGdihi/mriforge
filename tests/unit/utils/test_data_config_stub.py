A stand-in only earns trust while it matches the schema. These tests resolve
every name it claims against the live schema, so the stub cannot quietly drift
into a shape nothing produces -- which is the exact failure it exists to prevent
(31 tests stayed green over phase-9a-broken code because the stand-ins agreed
with the broken guards).
