"""Regression: previously-unregistered training modes are now in the allow-list.

The `privileged_learning`/`privileged` and `multi` strategies were dispatchable
via an explicit ``strategy_class`` but absent from ``VALID_TRAINING_MODES`` /
``TRAINING_MODE_CONSTRAINTS``, so an experiment selecting them by
``training_mode`` would fail the audit. 2026-05-31: registered them so their
experiments can be audit-clean.
