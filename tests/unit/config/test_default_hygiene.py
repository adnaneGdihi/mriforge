"""Default hygiene: a gated gate.

The rule this file enforces:

    In a schema class whose own gate is ``enabled: bool = False``, no
    ``enable_*`` / ``use_*`` sub-field may default to ``True``.

Why it matters is a *presentation* problem with a behavioural tail. While the
parent is off the sub-flag does nothing, but the resolved-config artifact stamps
every default (deliberately -- pitfall #15c), so the run record reads "motion
corruption: on" for a twin that never ran. And the moment somebody sets
``enabled: true`` they silently buy every sub-flag nobody asked for.

**The gate is the deliverable, not the sweep.** Measuring the five current
violations against the corpus found that fixing them is not a hygiene edit at
all -- see ``KNOWN_TRUE_UNDER_DISABLED_PARENT``, where every entry carries the
number of arms that would change behaviour. A convention nobody can violate
accidentally outlives a one-time rename; this test is that convention.
