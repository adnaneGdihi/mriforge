"""Tests for ``config/schemas/base.py`` — the schema-version SSOT.

These assert the **seam**, not the constant. A test that restates the accepted
set as a literal passes whether or not any gate actually consults it, which is
the condition the constant exists to rule out. The set was three independent
literals (``config/settings.py`` twice, ``config/schemas/training/base.py``
once) and nothing tied them together, so each could drift while agreeing with
itself.

The three tiers introduced on 2026-08-03 have since collapsed to two.
``LEGACY_CONFIG_VERSIONS`` was the middle tier — versions accepted only because
the loader *folded* them — and PR #891 deleted the fold and emptied the set. So
``ACCEPTED_CONFIG_VERSIONS`` is now exactly ``{CANONICAL_CONFIG_VERSION}``:
"accepted" and "current" mean the same thing again, and a declared ``6.0``/
``6.1`` is **refused**, not rewritten.

``TestVersionRetirement`` below pins that emptiness directly, because an empty
tier is the one thing a parametrised test cannot pin — iterating the set would
silently run zero cases and pass. (It replaced ``TestVersionFold``, which pinned
the fold that no longer exists.)

So every test below drives a **real gate** with a real value and asserts the
behaviour tracks the constant. The accept-side tests are parametrised over
``ACCEPTED_CONFIG_VERSIONS`` itself, so adding a version to the SSOT and
forgetting to make a gate honour it fails here rather than at a user's config.
