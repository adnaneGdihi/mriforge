"""Schema-level pins for ``training.vae`` and the KL-annealing alias folding.

``training.vae`` was READ by ``models/losses/computers/unified_vae.py`` but never
DECLARED on ``TrainingStrategyConfigSchema``. Because that schema is
``extra='allow'``, the block was admitted as a raw ``dict`` and every
``getattr(training.vae, "kl_beta_end", None)`` in the resolver returned ``None``
— a knob that validated clean and was never read (pitfall #15).

Independently, the 26 experiment YAMLs carrying the block spell the knobs
``enable_kl_annealing`` / ``kl_anneal_start`` / ``kl_anneal_end`` while the
schema and resolver spell them ``anneal_kl_beta`` / ``kl_beta_start`` /
``kl_beta_end``. ``AliasChoices`` folds both spellings onto one canonical field
so the KL weight keeps a single resolver (pitfall #13b).

Behavioural coverage of the resolved weight lives in
``tests/unit/models/losses/computers/test_unified_vae.py::TestKLAnnealNamingSchism``.
