"""The 2026-08 knob-wiring batch: paradigm blocks that arrived as raw dicts.

``TrainingStrategyConfigSchema`` is ``extra="allow"``, so a paradigm block the
schema never declares is stored as the plain ``dict`` it arrived as. Every
strategy reads its knobs with ``getattr(cfg, "knob", default)`` — and ``getattr``
on a dict returns the **default**. The YAML validates, the key reaches
provenance, and the declared value is discarded.

The tests below are ordered by what they prove:

1. the blocks coerce at all (the mechanism);
2. every default equals the strategy's own fallback, so an arm that does NOT
   declare the block is bit-for-bit unaffected (the no-regression control);
3. a typo raises instead of sitting unread (what ``extra="forbid"`` buys);
4. **the ablation ablates** — the assertion that actually mattered. Two real
   corpus arms whose declared ``lambda_t`` differs used to resolve to the same
   value, so any measured delta between them was noise.

(4) is the red-then-green case: before the blocks were declared it failed,
because both arms resolved ``lambda_t == 0.01``.
