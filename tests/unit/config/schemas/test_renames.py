# `TestEveryRaiseRecordCanActuallyBeRefused` lived here until 2026-08-22. Its
# invariant -- a retired spelling must FAIL rather than vanish -- now has ONE
# owner, `tests/unit/config/schemas/test_rename_mounts.py`, and this one was
# deleted rather than kept beside it (non-negotiable 17: never keep the weaker
# checker as defence in depth, because neither is then audited as the sole line
# of defence).
#
# It lost on three counts, all of which it passed green:
#
#  * It asserted a DISJUNCTION, `forbids or mounts_reject`, so a block that
#    mounted nothing passed on `extra="forbid"` alone. `reporting` was in that
#    state and the docstring named it as acceptable -- pydantic refused the key
#    but never said what replaced it, so the record's guided message (the
#    replacement, the reason, #503, and the one-line fixer) had never once
#    reached a user. A characterisation test that pins the defect it should
#    report.
#  * It detected a mount with `vars(schema)`, which sees only the class's OWN
#    dict: an INHERITED mount is invisible (`training/base.py` mounts one that
#    seven diffusion `*Params` subclasses inherit), as is any mount not bound
#    to the name `_reject_renamed`.
#  * `_block_schema` returned `None` for a nested block and the test SKIPPED,
#    so `training.diffusion` was never covered and said so in a skip nobody read.
#
# The history it carried is worth keeping, and now lives in
# `rename_mounts.py`'s module docstring: 57 of ~163 mounted schema classes are
# `extra="ignore"`, and when the first 31 records were promoted to `raise`, 28
# landed in blocks (`data`, `logging`, `losses`, `validation`) that mounted
# `fold_renamed_keys` and no `reject_renamed_keys` -- so the retired key was
# accepted and discarded, and `exclude_defaults` came back `[]` from a config
# that declared `["mse"]`. That is why the promotion precondition exists.
