"""The mount audit, planted against before it is trusted (non-negotiable 15).

Every assertion about the REAL tree here is worth exactly as much as the
detector behind it, and a detector that has only ever been run on a green tree
has never been shown to go red. So each shape the audit claims to catch is
planted as a synthetic schema tree plus a synthetic record table, and asserted
to produce the finding. The real-tree tests come last, after the detector has
earned them.

The plants are call-site plants: they run the same :func:`audit_mounts` the
real-tree tests run, on inputs it accepts by parameter. Nothing is stubbed.
