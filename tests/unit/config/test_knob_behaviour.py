"""Behavioural wiring tests: does setting a knob actually change what gets built?

Acceptance is the weakest possible signal. A key can validate, survive
``extra="forbid"``, appear in provenance, and still be discarded before it
reaches the object that acts on it. ``optimization.optimizer.betas`` does exactly that: it
has a ``@field_validator``, and ``_create_optimizer`` reads ``beta1``/``beta2``
instead, so a declared ``(0.5, 0.6)`` trains at ``(0.5, 0.999)``.

Static analysis cannot see that. These tests build the real artifact twice, once
per knob value, and assert the artifact differs. The knob is wired if and only
if the thing it configures changes.

Each table below carries its own control group of knobs known to be wired. Those
are not padding: they are what proves the harness can detect wiring at all. A
suite where every case is expected to fail cannot distinguish "knob is dead"
from "harness is broken".

``WIRED`` cases must pass. ``FACADE`` cases are ``xfail(strict=True)``, so when
someone wires one up the suite fails on the unexpected pass and forces the table
to be corrected. The table is therefore the living inventory of which knobs are
known not to work.

Companion to ``test_schema_key_consumption.py``, which asks the cheaper question
(is the key referenced at all). This one asks whether the reference does
anything.
