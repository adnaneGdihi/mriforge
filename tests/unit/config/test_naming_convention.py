"""The config-schema naming convention, enforced.

A reader cannot skim a config whose keys follow no rule. The census behind these
rules (1,888 unique field names across 295 classes) found a clear plurality for
each, so this ratifies existing practice rather than imposing a new style:

===================  =========================  =========================
Kind                 Rule                       Basis
===================  =========================  =========================
Boolean switch       ``enable_<thing>``         165 vs 20 ``use_*`` / 4 ``*_enabled``
A block's own gate   bare ``enabled``           reserved; never a feature flag
Count                ``num_<thing>``            36 vs 30 ``n_*``
Fraction in [0,1]    ``<thing>_fraction``       12 vs 5 ``*_ratio``
Negation             forbidden                  invert the sense instead
===================  =========================  =========================

**The gate is the deliverable, not the sweep.** A convention nobody can violate
by accident outlives any one-time rename, so this ships green: today's violators
are grandfathered in ``KNOWN_NAMING_EXCEPTIONS`` and each decomposition phase
drains the ones it already touches. New fields get no such grace.

Two rules from the plan's table are documented but deliberately NOT gated here.
The registry-selector rule (``<thing>_type`` over ``_mode`` / ``_strategy``)
cannot be mechanically separated from a genuine *mode*, and the path rule
(``_path`` file / ``_dir`` directory / ``_root`` tree) is a 16-16 split that has
to be decided per field by what it points at. Gating either on a name alone would
produce false failures, which is how a ratchet gets disabled.
