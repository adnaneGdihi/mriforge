"""Tests for ``scripts/ci/report_discarded_config_keys.py``.

The census answers one question -- which declared keys does the schema drop --
and it can be wrong in two directions. Under-reporting is the obvious one. The
one that actually bit is the other: a config that **never loaded** was scored
the same as a config that loaded and was clean, because both paths returned
``[]``. The roll-up then printed ``scanned N`` over both populations together.

That is not hypothetical, and it is not confined to the corpus. Run against
``src/mriforge/config/presets`` -- three YAMLs that ship *inside the package* --
the pre-fix tool printed:

    scanned 3 config(s) under src/mriforge/config/presets
    0 declaration(s) SILENTLY DISCARDED across 0 key(s), in 0 arm(s)
      (none)

A clean bill of health over a directory where nothing loaded at all. The three
presets declare ``config_version: '6.0'``, which the loader rejects outright.

So the contract pinned here is a **tri-state**, not a count: ``None`` for
did-not-load, ``[]`` for loaded-and-clean, a non-empty list for loaded-and-dirty.
A test that only asserted "no discarded keys reported" would have passed against
the broken version -- so each test below is written to fail if the two silent
states are collapsed back together.
