    field wants a reader — but here neither applied. ``required_axes`` alone
    drives ``check_workflow_required_axes``, and an *optional* axis has no rule
    to state, since by construction its absence cannot make an arm
    inadmissible. Its only possible reader would have been a rule that cannot
    fire, so the field was decoration.

    Asserted on the dataclass rather than on the values, because
    ``default_factory=frozenset`` made "every profile leaves it empty" and "the
    field does not exist" indistinguishable from the outside — which is how it
    survived two audits.
