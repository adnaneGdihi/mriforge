"""Regression test for the Wave-2 ledger-restored model aliases.

Twenty name-variant ``model_type`` strings were purged from
``VALID_MODEL_TYPES`` in commit ``d8ccb8452`` and then re-added as
aliases in ``mriforge.models.stubs.register_aliases`` (Phase 1 of
``TODO/deleted_model_types_reimplementation_plan.md``).

``ALIAS_TABLE`` below is the frozen source of truth. Each alias MUST
resolve to the *same class object* as its canonical name after the
registry is populated — otherwise the advertised name is an
"audit-surface lie" (green Tier-0 audit, ``KeyError`` at build time).
If a future edit drops an alias from ``stubs.py``, this test fails
rather than silently regressing the registry surface.
