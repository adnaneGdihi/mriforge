"""SwinBlock: the shifted-window mask must follow the resolution (#1345).

The mask used to be a persistent buffer pinned to ``input_resolution``, and the
branch in ``forward`` that noticed a changed resolution was an empty ``pass``.
``WindowAttention`` reads its window count off ``mask.shape[0]``, so the stale
mask did not merely mis-weight the attention -- it reshaped the attention
tensor by the wrong factor. With 16 real windows and a 4-window mask the view
became ``(4 batches, 4 windows)`` and succeeded; at 9 real windows it raised a
``RuntimeError`` from deep inside the attention.
