"""VQ quantizer: the two halves of #1340.

1. EMA codebook updates must not participate in autograd. The EMA statistics
   are *state*, updated by assignment. Before the ``no_grad`` guard each
   in-place write appended to the autograd graph, so the graph grew
   monotonically for the life of the run -- an unbounded VRAM leak that
   presents as a mid-run OOM rather than as a wrong number.

2. ``vq_loss`` must be exactly ``commitment_cost * commitment_loss``. The term
   that used to sit beside it, labelled "codebook loss", was the commitment
   expression with its ``F.mse_loss`` arguments swapped -- and ``mse`` is
   symmetric, so it was the same tensor twice. The encoder was pulled at
   ``1 + commitment_cost`` = 5x the documented weight.
