"""Regression guard for the dimension-contract back-fill.

The high-traffic models below were given ModelCapabilities declarations
(2026-06-24, Layer-1 of the dimension-contract plan) so the audit can check
their dimension flow instead of fail-soft skipping. This test pins those
declarations so a future refactor can't silently drop them back to ``None``
(which would re-open the default-deny gap).
