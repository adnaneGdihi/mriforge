"""``NeuralODEGenerator``: the solver it picks, and what that costs per forward.

Three defects lived in ``forward`` at once, and each one is invisible to a test
that only checks the output shape:

1. A ten-iteration loop computed the four RK4 stages and **never wrote back to**
   ``h``. Its results were rebound and discarded, so the reconstruction was
   correct -- it simply cost twice what it should. Eight arms select this model,
   two of them under ``experiments/validated/``.
2. ``from torchdiffeq import odeint`` sat **inside** ``forward``. Python does not
   negative-cache a failed import, so every step re-ran the whole ``sys.meta_path``
   finder search.
3. ``except ImportError: pass`` chose a different integrator without a word, and
   the two integrators did not even share a grid: ``linspace(0, T, 10)`` is nine
   intervals of ``T/9``, while the built-in solver walks ten of ``T/10``.

Each test below fails on the specific shape it names. None of them reads source
text -- a comment or a docstring must not be able to satisfy them.
