"""Declared physics must not silently no-op (experiment_11 collapse triage).

``KSpaceColdDiffusionGenerator`` gates BOTH data consistency and the output
magnitude bound on ``kwargs["kspace_measured"]``. Both used to skip in silence
when it was missing or batch-mismatched, so ``dc_method``,
``physics.data_consistency.enabled`` and ``output_kspace_clip_ratio`` could all
be advertised in the YAML, accepted by the audit and stamped into provenance
while the forward returned the raw backbone proposal (pitfall #16).

With the measurement present an untrained net is pinned to the band-local
ceiling; without it the output runs free, which for a log-scaling arm is then
fed to an ``expm1`` at the k-space -> image boundary.

Deliberately NOT claimed here: that this is what blacked out the experiment_11
validation images. An out-of-range but finite prediction still renders --
``MetricsTracker._normalize_images`` uses percentile windowing, and a prediction
with up to 10% of its bins past ``DECOMPRESS_MAGNITUDE_CEILING`` saves as an
ordinary full-range PNG. A bit-exact black image needs an all-zero, constant, or
NaN prediction. These tests pin the mechanism they can actually demonstrate.
