"""End-to-end tests for the CSMNOOperator generator.

Pins the contract that the integration plan signs on:

* The model registers under ``cs_mno_operator`` with mode
  ``reconstruction``.
* Forward and backward pass succeed at the configured spatial shape.
* The model raises (no silent fallback) when called on a different
  spatial shape than it was constructed for.
* The 2-D / 3-D scan-mode cross-check rejects mismatched ranks.
