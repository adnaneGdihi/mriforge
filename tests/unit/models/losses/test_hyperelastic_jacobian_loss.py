"""Grad-flow unit tests for HyperelasticJacobianLoss.

The canonical paired test file was missing (the review noted it was only
exercised functionally in test_vf_methods.py with no ``.backward()``). Pin that
the Jacobian-determinant regulariser is genuinely differentiable — a loss whose
gradient is zero / detached is inert regardless of the returned scalar.
