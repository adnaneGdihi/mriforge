"""Tests for :mod:`mriforge.models.losses.composed_loss`.

The contract under test is the ``want_metrics`` gate on ``WeightedLoss.compute``
(production-plan row D07#8). Three properties have to hold together, and each is
a separate failure mode:

1. ``ComposedLoss.forward`` must not run any component's ``compute_metrics``.
   That method performs ~7 ``.item()`` device-to-host syncs per component, and
   the training loop calls ``forward`` every step (non-negotiable 9).
2. ``ComposedLoss.compute_metrics`` must still return component metrics. The
   gate defaults to off, so the metric-consuming call sites have to opt back in
   explicitly -- forgetting one silently drops the feature rather than failing.
3. A component whose ``forward`` returns ``(loss, metrics)`` must still yield a
   scalar. Gating the branch made the plain path reachable for the five losses
   that take a ``compute_metrics=True`` constructor flag; without an unwrap,
   ``tuple * float`` raises and ``tuple * int`` silently returns a longer tuple.
