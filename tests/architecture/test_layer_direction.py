"""
TASK III.2 – Layer-direction fitness function.

Enforces CLAUDE.md "Architecture (load-bearing)" inward-only dep rule:

    cli/ → pipelines/ → application/ → infrastructure/ → models/, domain/ → core/, config/

Lower layers must never import from higher ones.  Also: nothing under
src/mriforge/ may import from a repo-root tree that is not in the wheel
(``scripts``, ``tools``, ``scratch``, ``runners``, ``tests``) -- see
``NONPACKAGE_ROOTS``.

Gate test (fast, always runs):
    Collect violations, subtract the pre-existing allowlist from
    ``_known_violations.json``, fail if any NEW violations exist.

Cleanup tracker (slow, opt-in with -m slow):
    Fails as long as known violations remain (debt tracker).
