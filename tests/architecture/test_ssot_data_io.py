TASK III.2 – Data-IO SSOT fitness function.

Enforces CLAUDE.md pitfall #11:

    No ``torch.load``, ``h5py.File``, ``nib.load`` / ``nibabel.load``, or
    ``pickle.load`` outside ``mriforge/data/``.

All file-to-tensor loading must go through the DataPipelineDirector and live
under src/mriforge/data/.  Higher layers consume datasets via the director;
they never open files directly.

Gate test (fast, always runs):
    Fail on any violation not in _known_violations.json["data_io"].

Cleanup tracker (slow, opt-in with -m slow):
    Fails until all known violations are fixed.

    AST, not text. The predecessor was ``re.compile(r"\btorch\.load\b")`` over
    the raw file, which cannot tell a call from prose — and it did not, twice:

    * ``pipelines/infer.py:539`` carries a docstring reading *"pipeline layer
      never calls ``h5py.File`` / ``nib.load`` / ``np.load``"*. The oracle read a
      sentence **asserting compliance** and recorded the file as breaking the
      rule, so two of that file's three baseline entries described nothing.
    * ``core/module_utils.py:199`` says *"payload: Whatever ``torch.load``
      returned."* — unbaselined, so it **failed the gate outright**.

    Five of the 44 text matches across ``src/mriforge/`` were of this kind.

    Module aliases are followed too (``import torch as th; th.load(p)``). That
    hole was free to close: the only nonstandard aliases of the four guarded
    modules anywhere in ``src/mriforge/`` are two ``import torch as _torch``
    (``meta_evaluation/figures.py:895``, ``mixins/metrics_mixin.py:101``), and
    neither reaches ``.load`` — so it adds 0 baseline entries today and shuts
    the door before the first one does.

    **Not detected, deliberately:** binding the function object and calling it
    later (``fn = torch.load; fn(p)``). That needs dataflow, and the one
    non-call reference in the tree today is a version probe
    (``getattr(torch.load, "__code__", None)`` in ``shared/utils/safe_io.py``)
    whose file is baselined for the real call beneath it. Flagging a symbol
