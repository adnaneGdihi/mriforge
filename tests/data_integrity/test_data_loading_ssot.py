"""SSOT guard: data loading must route through ``src/data/``.

CLAUDE.md pitfall #11 mandates that any code turning a file (``.h5``,
``.pt``, ``.nii.gz``, ``.npy``, ``.pkl``) into a ``torch.utils.data.Dataset``
or ``DataLoader`` must live under ``src/data/``.

This test pins the current state of forbidden file-load patterns
outside ``src/data/``. The intent:

- **New violations fail the test immediately** (regression guard).
- **Fixing an allowlisted violation also fails** the test (force the
  fixer to update this allowlist, so the documentation stays honest).

Allowlist categories (legitimate, not pipeline data loading):

- Physics helpers loading static config-like artifacts (coil-sensitivity
  maps, sampling patterns) — not Dataset construction.
- I/O adapter primitives at the bottom of the data layer
  (``src/infrastructure/io/adapters.py``).
- Checkpoint service loading model weights (not data).
- CLI utilities + reporting plotters that operate on artifacts after
  training, not during it.
- Docstring examples (we look for the actual call site, but accept
  files whose only hits are in docstrings).

Phase-1 targets (planned removals, currently allowlisted with the
``"phase1_target"`` marker so the test reminds us to remove them when
the eval bypass is plugged):

- ``src/infrastructure/orchestration/campaign_evaluator.py``
- ``src/pipelines/infer.py`` (Phase-2 target, also currently allowlisted)
