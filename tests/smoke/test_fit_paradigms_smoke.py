"""End-to-end smoke verification for ``spectramr.pipelines.fit.fit`` paradigms.

This is the **non-facade verifier**: it runs each paradigm's ``fit(...)`` for a
couple of real iterations on a tiny synthetic ``(input, target)`` loader with a
paradigm-appropriate model, and asserts the run completes AND the paradigm's
*distinctive* loss key actually appears in the result (a present-but-absent
distinctive loss is the silent-collapse facade the codebase polices — pitfalls
#10/#16). Adding a tailored ``fit()`` default for a new paradigm should come with
an entry here.

.. warning::

   These run a real training loop (DI container + model + loop) and are **heavy**
   — run them on the cluster, NOT on a dev box (a single fit() loop can OOM-kill
   an interactive machine). They are marked ``smoke`` so they stay out of the
   fast unit suite; invoke explicitly with ``pytest tests/smoke/test_fit_paradigms_smoke.py``.

The harness is paradigm-agnostic: each case supplies ``(paradigm, model_factory,
distinctive_loss_substr, extra_fit_kwargs)``. Reconstruction is the baseline that
proves the harness itself; the rest extend it.
