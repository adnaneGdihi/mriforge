"""Regression test: SSOT compliance for FFT operations.

CLAUDE.md pitfall #2 forbids raw ``torch.fft.fft2`` / ``torch.fft.ifft2`` (and
their N-dim / 1-D variants) on complex MRI k-space. Use
``mriforge.infrastructure.physics.fft_ops.fft2c`` / ``ifft2c`` instead — they
handle centering, ``norm="ortho"``, and AMP-safe FP32 context together.

This test AST-walks every ``src/`` module and partitions raw ``torch.fft.*``
call sites into three buckets:

1. ``INTENTIONAL_EXEMPT`` — files where the raw call is architecturally
   justified (SSOT itself, spectral PDE solvers, 1D temporal filters).
2. ``LEGACY_EXEMPT_BUDGET`` — pre-SSOT-migration tech debt, locked at the
   current per-file call count. New violations in these files (count
   grows) and new files outside both lists both fail the test.
3. Everything else — a violation if any forbidden call is present.

``rfft`` / ``irfft`` / ``rfft2`` / ``irfft2`` / ``rfftn`` / ``irfftn`` and
the spectrum-shape helpers ``fftshift`` / ``ifftshift`` / ``fftfreq`` are
NOT in the forbidden set: they're used by spectral neural operators (FNO,
S4D, Hyena, Hermitian-equivariant blocks) on real-valued feature maps,
which are explicitly exempt per CLAUDE.md.

To clear a legacy entry: rewrite the file to use ``fft2c`` / ``ifft2c`` and
delete the entry from ``LEGACY_EXEMPT_BUDGET``. To add a NEW intentional
exemption: add to ``INTENTIONAL_EXEMPT`` with a written reason explaining
why ``fft2c`` is not applicable.

    this module used while it lived under ``tests/unit/physics/``. That form
    is what kept the guard *out* of the blocking lane for as long as it did:
    moving the file to ``tests/physics/`` (one level shallower) silently
    re-rooted ``SRC_DIR`` at a directory with no ``src/``, and the primary

    the budget entries, which would have made the guard permanently blind.

    Anchoring on ``src/mriforge`` rather than on ``pyproject.toml`` or ``.git``

    worse than no tree at all.

    ``fft2c`` / ``fftnc``, and the uncentered family was renamed
    ``*_uncentered`` so no caller can reach it without naming the convention.
    The remaining ``self.fft.*`` receivers this matcher cannot see are therefore
    centred; the blindness is unchanged, what it hides is not.

    This test does not endorse the gap; it pins it, so the day someone widens
    the matcher to aliased receivers the change is deliberate and this is the
    test they edit.
